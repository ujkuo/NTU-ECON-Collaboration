now that we have to find a nash equilibrium let's see how well does it
do as a solution concept last week we have used three criteria to
evaluate solution concepts namely we have looked at existence does it exist
in any game it's predictive power does it reasonably
narrow down set of all strategy profiles and lastly robustness is it robust to
small mistakes or estimation errors of the player's payoffs
and here i want to start with existence the good news is that a nash equilibrium
always exists in mixed strategies at least if the players have finitely many
strategies available and this result is due to nash in 1950.
now i do want to spend some time going through this proof because one is the
most fundamental solution concept and two because existence of all the future
concepts that we will look at in the class can essentially be reduced to

00:01
existence of nash equilibrium the main motivation behind the proof is
to go back at the very fundamental definition of a nash equilibrium namely
that it's a mutual best response by the player we have already defined
the best response correspondences of each players and now we define
the mutual best response operator and is given by
the direct product here of all the best response correspondences by the
different players so what this means is the result here will again be
well a strategy profile so this will be a set of strategy profiles where the
first component is a best respond best response
to the strategy profile by player one's opponents the second component will be a
best response to player two's opponents and so on and a nash equilibrium is

00:02
well a mutual best response which means that sigma in natural room sigma is
an element of b sigma because sigma 1 is the best response
to player 1 bonus and so on so this means it's a fixed point of this operator b
and the main idea will be to apply a suitable fixed point theorem
now we will start by visualizing the proof for a two person two action game
because we can easily draw the best response functions nicely and then we
will try to see how could we generalize this to the end player
and finitely many action game now let's start with brower's fixed point theorem
this theorem is not directly related to nash equilibrium but it is the easiest
fixed point theorem and kind of gives us the idea of
how some other fixed point theorems work so what the theorem says is that if we
have a function from 0 1 to 0 1 and if that function is continuous then

00:03
it must have a fixed point and the basic idea behind it is that if we
draw any function here from from 0 1 2 0 1 then we must
cross the diagonal once and at the diagonal um we must have a fixed point
now let's discuss the assumption so the the continuity assumption i think is
quite clear if we have a discontinuous function then we could jump across the
diagonal and then we wouldn't have a fixed point
there's a second assumption here which is about the domain and the domain here
from zero one has three special properties namely
it is closed it is bounded and is convexed to see why it has to be closed
that we look at the open interval from 0
1 then this function here would not have
to have an intersection because it could always lie below the diagonal if zero
was excluded then why the domain has to be bounded

00:04
well if it was unbounded then we could have
a function that always lies above the diagonal let's say a parabola one plus x
square would always lie above the diagonal and then convex means that the domain
does not have any gaps and the reason why it's necessary is
visualized here in this in this figure um if domain had a gap then
the function would not have a fixed point or could not have a fixed point by
definition so even one minus x would not have a fixed point if we elim or remove
the center part where the fixed point would occur if we remove that from the
domain but if all of those are satisfied and
the function is continuous then it must have a fixed point now
a best response correspondence is not a function it is a correspondence

00:05
which means it can have several values not just one so we need to
extend this idea to correspondences so let's visualize this with two player
games where both players have two actions where we know that we can parametrize
the player's strategies with simply one variable let's say the probability
that they choose the first of their actions and we've seen that a correspondence
is the name mapping from 0 1 two zero one
where as input it takes the probability or the strategy of
player one's opponent so in this case y and it gives us back which values of x
are best responses and only three cases can happen
either player one prefers their first action their second action or player one
is indifferent and if it is indifferent is precisely
the case when the correspondence is not single valued
and we have here a few of those cases so here is where the best response

00:06
correspondence is not single valued and the consequence if we now look at
this graph is that they must always intersect the mutual best or the
best response correspondences because they are sort of
continuous in a sense that we can draw the graph without ever removing the
paper from the pen and we just have to sort of formalize
what a continuous correspondence is in this setting so
we have to prevent two kinds two kinds of gaps we have to prevent horizontal
gaps and vertical gaps horizontal gaps can happen if the best
response correspondence is empty and if we ask them to be non-empty then
horizontal gaps won't happen to prevent vertical gaps we need two
conditions we need that the best response correspondence is convex so

00:07
this means that if any two strategies are best response that
anything any convex combination of them is also a best response
and the second condition that we need is that the graph
of the best response correspondence is closed so the graph here is simply
exactly what it says is how we draw we draw the graph it's the pair of all
the inputs and all the outputs and the reason why we need both is that
this is a case here where the best response corresponds is convex but there is a
or a vertical gap because the graph is not closed conversely
this now is one where the graph is closed so the endpoints are included but
there is a vertical gap because the best response correspondence is not
convex so for x equal to one half there's two best
responses but anything in between is not the best response

00:08
and once we have both conditions then there are no more vertical gaps
and so those will be the conditions under which a correspondence is sort of
continuous and this brings us to kagutani's fixed
point theorem which is the theorem we want to apply
for or to establish existence of nash equilibrium
and it's essentially a correspondence version of brower's fixed point theorem
and it says that a correspondence does have a fixed point if
the first condition if the domain is non-empty convex and compact subset of
euclidean space so euclidean space here is rn then
the correspondence is non-empty and convex for all values so those two together
will give us this continuity of the best response correspondence
actually those two sorry two and three the correspondence has a closed graph

00:09
and the first one is about the domain which is similar that we had in
brower's fixed point theorem right that that the domain is non-empty convex and
compact so there are no gaps in the domain
and the proof of nash existence theorem will now be verifying these three
conditions in our setting and then we can use cacutana's fixed point theorem to
establish a fixed point of the best response or the mutual best response
operator so let's first verify that the domain
satisfies also all those conditions that we need
so what is the domain well the domain is simply the set of all mixed strategy
profiles and because we look at finite games here it means
that the set of all mixed strategies by player i is

00:10
this simplex here right this triangle shaped form in rd
so in particular it's on empty convex and compact and the product of
all these non-empty convex and compact sets is then also convex and compact
in particular because we take the finite product here it is also non-empty
all right this tells us that the domain satisfies all
the conditions that we need then let's now check that the graph of the
best response are the mutual best response operator is closed
to do that we need to approximate a limit point and then show that the limit
itself is a best response so to set up the proof we find
some strategy profile sigma we approximate it with a sequence of

00:11
strategy profiles such that along the sequence player i always best responds to
[Music] the strategic profiles of his opponents
and then we to show that it has a close graph we must show that um in the limit
sigma i has to be a best response to the limit profile of player i's opponents
and if we show this for every player i then it will also be true for the mutual
best response operator so we show this by a contradiction we
suppose that it's not true right that all of those are satisfied
but that in the limit we don't get the best response
now if we don't get the best response this means that there must be some
better response so in particular some pure strategy that gives us a strictly
higher payoff and let's denote the increase of payoff that the pure

00:12
strategy gives by epsilon now because the approximating sequence of strategy
profiles converges there must exist some index k naught
such that for any index larger than that for any k larger than that
the distance in utilities or the difference in utilities is less
than epsilon half and right this happens because the utilities are
continuous in the strategy profile because how we take it's essentially an
expectation but now this means that for any k above those we can't have a
so sigma ik cannot be a best response because if in the limit it's
worse by epsilon and along the approximating sequence we
lose less than epsilon half then somewhere

00:13
along the approximating sequence it must already happen that
strategy by player i is dominated by s i by at least epsilon half
so this contradicts the assumption that along the sequence player i
plays a best response so this means that the graph
has to be closed because that's the only the only other option
then lastly the last thing that remains is to show that
the best response correspondences are convex and non-empty so for convexity
let us rewrite the set of best responses as all those strategies by player i
that attain the optimal or the maximum of expected utilities overall um of

00:14
player i strategies this means for any two best responses
they have to attain exactly the same utility and will denote that by v i
now to show convexity we take the convex
combination of any two strategy profiles which defines a valid strategy profile
because all of those so each strategy profile
the probabilities attached to all the pure strategies they sum up to one
and then if we weight them with these weights lambda and one minus
lambda then the sum of them will still add up to one
so if we look at the expected utility the expression that we will get is this
and because this is a sum of a sum we can write this as two sums so lambda times
the the sum over all pure strategies of these two terms and then plus one minus
lambda times the sum over all pure strategies of these two terms

00:15
and what we obtain is then okay lambda times the utility and sigma i
plus one minus lambda utility and sigma hat i and because both of those attain
the same utility we get vi and so it has to be a best response
this shows that it is convex and again because there's finitely many
players and we've shown this for an arbitrary player it also means that the
mutual best response operator is convex lastly we have to show that
the best response response is non-empty again we show it by player by player
now because there are finitely many strategies the
maximum of player is utility over all pure strategies is certainly attained as
the maximum over finitely many options and the maximum over the pure strategies
has to be a best response because by the indifference principle
if a mixed strategy is the best response then also all the pure strategies in

00:16
support are a best response so this means that at least one pure
strategy has to be in the support namely the pure strategy
or has to be a best response namely the pure strategy that maximizes player i's
utility so this shows that the best response
correspondence is not empty and we can apply
the calculations fixed point theorem which tells us there is a fixed point
and the fixed point of the mutual best response operator is precisely a nash
equilibrium and this concludes the proof of existence now in addition to
existence we wondered about predictive power
are nash equilibria unique well we've already seen that they are not unique
crossing the intersection had three possible nash equilibrium but i wouldn't
necessarily say that this is a disadvantage
it means that even infinitely rational individuals have freedom of joints and

00:17
several possible outcomes are consistent with rational behavior and
and correct conjectures about the other players strategies
the only thing that is important is that predictions are
meaningful so this means that the solution set is sufficiently restrictive
and we have seen that in the example with the intersection it
was much much smaller than let's say the rationalizable strategies for which we
obtained all the possible strategy profiles
in particular the two solutions that we got are very meaningful it's those that
we see in reality where one of the two crosses intersection and the
other one waits now we will further refine nash equilibrium for
the remainder of the class essentially starting next week where we
think that in some situations certain nash equilibria are unreasonable
and then we will try to narrow down the set of nash equilibria by imposing

00:18
additional restrictions and this is sort of the plan for the next six weeks
the robustness the last criteria and we will find that nash equivalent are
not robust so here is the example of a game where there are
two pure strategy nash equilibria but one in weekly dominated strategies and
weak dominance is not robust so if we look at
a very small perturbation of payoffs here if we subtract epsilon from this
outcome here then this is no longer a best response for player 2 and so
tr is not a nash equilibrium in any approximation of the game so this means
that this is not a robust nash equilibrium now that we've discussed these

00:19
properties how does nash equilibrium relate to the solution concepts that
we've seen well it's definitely um definitely contains strict dominant
strategy equilibria because yeah if every player has a strictly
dominant strategy then this is the unique best response to anything the
other players could play so this is the only possible match equilibrium so any
strict dominance equilibrium is a nash equilibrium
and also a nash equilibrium is definitely rationalizable because
in the nash equilibrium conjectures are correct so this means that um
that yeah it is the best response to a rationalizable conjecture because it is
rationalized again by um the nash equilibrium itself yeah so

00:20
and this i guess this relation here of the solution concepts highlights again
why nash equilibria are so popular we've seen that strict dominance is way too
restrictive doesn't always exist rationalizability is very permissive and
then nash equilibrium sort of hits the sweet spot in between where it always
exists but is still quite restrictive so that we can narrow down the sort of all
strategy profiles to a reasonable set that is much smaller good
the proof of the existence theorem is again in all the game theory textbooks
and of course again in nash's original paper so you can have a look at those if
you would like
