hello and welcome back to micro one this week's class is going to be a
little bit different in the sense that we don't have one large solution concept
that we want to introduce but we have a few different topics that
we want to cover and the first of those topics is going
to be kuhn's theorem and related to kuhn's theorem existence of subgame
perfect equilibria now the motivation for this video is
summarized in this slide here which is a
visual representation of how we find sub gain perfect equilibria
as we have discussed last week we're going backwards through the tree and we
start with the signals and information sets where we can find the solution by
backward induction after we have done that we start with
the smallest sub games in this game and we find the nash equilibria in all those
sub games then knowing what the continuation equilibrium are once

00:01
these nodes are reached we look at the next larger subgames and try to find the
equilibria there now the problem for existence of
supplement perfect equilibria is that what we're guaranteed here in these sub
games are nash equilibrium mixed strategies but a mixed strategy in one of those
subgames is neither a mixed strategy nor a behavior strategy in the entire game
right so here if we look at player 2 then in the sub game here
in the nash equilibrium of the subgame all the mixing is
realized here at this node this is not a mixed strategy an entire game where all
of player 2's mixing is resolved at the beginning of the game and it's neither a
behavior strategy where the mixing is resolved at each individual information
set so what we would like to have is we would like to have a result that tells

00:02
us under which condition a nash equilibrium strategies has some
kind of an equivalent nash equilibrium in behavior strategies because four
behavior strategies mixing is done at each information set and this is
consistent uh if we go backwards through the tree
now the first thing we need to figure out is what
what is the right notion here for equivalence between strategies so
two things should be satisfied by in order for us to call strategy sigma i
and strategy sigma hat i am equivalent i guess this should be an
i here not a minus sign specifically it can only be equivalent if
player i and all the other players earn the same payoff in both of those
strategies and then if we want to find or apply this to equilibria then we want
that incentives for the other players remain undisturbed

00:03
so that for every other player they're indifferent between
player i playing two equivalent strategies and one way how we can get this
is by imposing that for any strategy profile of eyes opponents
the induced distribution over the tree is the same for sigma i and sigma hat i
and indeed this is sufficient for the two conditions because
every outcome of the game is equally likely every node in the game tree is
reached with equal probability and so for all the other players it's exactly
the same whether player i plays sigma i or sigma hat i so the second property
here is satisfied but also for player i player i gets
the same payoffs and the same incentives at all the intermediate points and so
realization equivalent here is the notion that we are going with for

00:04
these extensive forum games and the intuition of how we find
equivalent mixed and behavior strategy is the following
so the intuition and i've mentioned last week that this intuition is somewhat
wrong but the intuition is that every pure strategy
leads to a unique terminal node and if that is the case then
we can find for any behavior strategy profile we can find a mixed strategy
profile that chooses the pure strategy that leads to that terminal node with
the probability with which this terminal
node is reached in the behavior strategy profile
and for the converse if we start with a mixed strategy profile then
then we have a mixture of pure strategies and in each of these pure
strategies we know which action profile or which action is

00:05
played at which information set and then the mixture of the mixed strategy
tells us essentially how frequently those actions are chosen at information
set hi so we normalize this by the total probability with which the information
set is reached so that overall we have a distribution
over actions available at information set hi now
the problem is there are two problems the first one is that a pure strategy
profile does not lead to a unique terminal node and
the second problem is here that we can't just define this for the entire
strategy profile we have to do this player by player
and this is what we're going to spend most of these videos on so
first the most surprising property here is that

00:06
not every terminal node can be reached by a pure strategy
and the following example illustrates that the idea is that
i'm driving home late at night and it's a long highway a dark highway let's
say you live somewhere in in ilan or something and
it's like 3 a.m at night nobody else is on the road
and kind of all the exits look the same and you're starting to forget whether
you have passed and exit or not and you're driving on this highway and
you optimally you would like to get home um and your home is at the second exit
um if you go out to early there will be some hotel
and you spend the night at the hotel and if you don't exit at all if you go all
the way to the end and you'll end up in some bad neighborhood and
the thing is here with no pure strategy can you actually get home

00:07
because you have only information only one information set um then
yeah there's one information set here this means we cannot distinguish these
two nodes which means we forget whether we have already passed an exit or not
so as long as we're on the highway we forget what they've already passed and
exit and a pure strategy has to choose the same action at both of
these nodes so if we exit then we end up at the hotel and if we
stay on the highway then we end up in the bad neighborhood but
the behavior strategy where we choose to exit the probability x at each node
and we continue with probability 1 minus
x leaves home with probability 1 minus x times x
and this behavior strategy has no realization equivalent mixed strategy because
a mixed strategy is a mixture of pure strategies and no pure strategies can

00:08
get home now let's try to formalize this example here into a result
and that's just the following here so if we have an extensive form game in which
there are no non there are no trivial nodes so at all the nodes every player
has at least two actions available then a behavior strategy
of any player has a realization equivalent mixed strategy if and only if
no two nodes in the same information set are
or one node comes before the other in the same information set so this means
no player forgets whether they have taken a move
so if no player forgets or they have taken a move then
each behavior strategy has a realization equivalent mixed strategy now this is
an if and only if result so we have to prove both directions and

00:09
the easier direction is that that if it's not satisfied so if
there are two such nodes then there cannot be a realization equivalent mixed
strategy and this is just a generalization of the example that we've had so
so we suppose that the condition does not hold that um
there is an information set with two nodes in the same information set where
one node comes before the other but then at the first node the first of
those nodes there's one specific pure action that
has to be taken at that node for play to reach x prime and
this means that at this information set in order to reach x prime
player i has to play some or this action a i star
but then this means that they also have to play a i star at x prime

00:10
and so any other action played or the note that is reached after any
other action is played at x prime cannot be reached by
a realization equal mixed strategy because it cannot be reached by a pure
strategy the other direction is more intricate and for the other direction
suppose that the conditions are met then we want to define a
so for each behavior strategy we want to find define a realization equivalent
mixed strategy and the idea is basically we go through the tree and we see
with which probability so for each pure strategy we look at
with which probability at each information set is

00:11
the action chosen that is prescribed by that pure strategy then we multiply
all of those probabilities together to get the weight that the mixed strategy
should assign to this pure strategy so the first thing that we have to
verify is that this is indeed a mixed strategy so we need to verify that the
sum of weights adds up to one in order to do that we will
represent a pure strategy as a vector where each component of the vector
corresponds to one information set by player i so
this is similar to how we abbreviated the notation of subject imperfection by
simply listing the actions in the right sequence
where each location in the sequence corresponds to one information set so here
we enumerate all the information sets by player i in

00:12
any fashion so we have m different information sets and then this vector
here means a i1 is played at hi1 ai2 is played at hi2 and so on
and so all pure strategies can be represented in this way
the entire set of pure strategies is then this set here and like we've
mentioned this is a vector where each component um crumbs comes from the right
set of actions now to see that all of these weights do
sum up to one we use this representation here
so if we sum over all pure strategies then this is the same as for each
information set we sum over all the possible actions
that can be taken at that information set and then
for all of those pure strategies we have this product here of all the
probabilities with which the right action is taken at the information set now

00:13
we notice here that only the last term only the information set m the action
taken at information set m depends on the summation variable here
so all the others we can move outside of the summation and
this summation here the sum will be one because
the probability that some action is taken
at information set h i right because we sum over all possible actions
this sum is one and then iteratively the entire product of these sums is one
so indeed this strategy sigma hat is a mixed strategy
and the next step will be to show that they are realization equivalent
now realization equivalent means that they induce the same distribution over

00:14
the game tree and we need to make sure that this is true
for every possible strategy profile of i's opponents
so what we want to define here is we want to decompose this probability
into a product of player specific probabilities so i want to say
we want to define for each player i the probability rho i that
player i takes all the right decisions in strategy sigma i for play to reach x
and then because mixing is done independently
across the players in either a behavior or a mixed strategy we then get that
the probability p sigma is indeed the product of all those player specific
probabilities with which they take the right actions for x to be reached and now

00:15
showing realization equivalent is identical to showing that row i
for the behavior strategy and the mixed strategy are identical
but before we can show this we need to think a bit a little bit about how those
are defined so okay we need to figure out the probability
that all the right decisions are taken to reach node x and so in a game tree we
we know that a node x is reached only if play evolves along one specific path
and so we list all the actions or i'm sorry all the nodes where player i is
the active player on the path from the root to x by x i 1 up to x i m i so that

00:16
they are ordered in sequence and then we denote by a of x i k towards x
so this indicates the action that has to be taken at this note here in order for
play to reach x and this action is unique now we can express the probability
with which player i takes all the right decisions
for node x to be reached in the behavior strategy sigma i and it's the product
along this entire sequence with which they choose the action that leads to the
next node on the sequence now for a mixed strategy
the probability that x is reached is simply the probability that a pure
strategy is chosen that leads to x right each pure strategy leads to a
deterministic path through the tree and so we simply sum up
over all those pure strategies whose deterministic path leads to x
so it means all the pure strategies in this set six

00:17
they're all they all agree up to x and they only differ in the continuation
game after x okay having defined those two we need to show that they are
equivalent for any behavior strategy sigma i if
players don't forget whether they have taken an action good so
what we'll have to distinguish here is the information sets
that lie before x and those that lie after x because in order to reach x only
those matter that are that contain nodes before x
and yeah so we write h i of x i k here the information set to which

00:18
node x i k belongs now this probability here in the behavior strategy is
the product of all the nodes all the information sets um
with which the right action is taking out all the information sets before x and
because all the x i's are distinct this is a potentially a non-zero
non-zero product and it's precisely equal to the probability with which um
i assay as i h i is chosen at h i so this is for any pure strategy
that for which x is reached the behavior strategy reaches x with
this probability here and it's the same as this one here because

00:19
no two nodes lie in the same information set then the second step is we
look at the probabilities under the mixed strategy and show that
this coincides with the behavior strategy
so by definition we sum up over all pure strategies whose play leads through x
and we plug in the definition of our mixed strategy which was the product of
all the probabilities with which the behavior strategy chooses the right action
for the pure strategy si now we can break up this product here
into two components so the first component are
the probability at all the notes taken before x

00:20
and the second product is all those taken not on the path from the root to x
now the first one is precisely rho i x for the behavior strategy sigma i
and we'll have to show that the remainder sums up to one
so rho i x sigma i does not depend on the summation variable so we can pull it
out of the summation and then the remaining term we have to show that
this is equal to one and this works in the same way as before
we can represent all the strategies that whose
all the pure strategies whose path leads to x we can represent this again
as a vector for over all the information sets
that the right decisions are taking all the information sets outside
those information sets that lead to x in the same way we can write this

00:21
sum over the pure strategies as the sum over all possible actions that are taken
at those information sets and then we can split the product and
each individual sum will sum up to one and so as a consequence rho i
x is the same for the behavior strategy and to make strategy and this concludes
the proof so this was the case when a behavior strategy has a realization
equivalent mixed strategy now what about the converse when is the
converse group when does a mixed strategy have a realization
equivalent behavior strategy so here is another motivating example of when
um there are more mixed strategies than behavior strategies
so the example here is that the white house press secretary can

00:22
either state a fact or an alternative fact during their press briefings and
a government may not always want to tell the truth to
the citizens sometimes they want to keep certain facts hidden to make themselves
appear better and the crucial component here is that the government
doesn't lie too frequently if they lie too often then it might not be worth
reporting anymore because there's no truth to the government
so they must lie sufficiently rarely to maintain their credibility so this means
that they will probably mix between um so it's
some probability they will truthfully tell a story and some other probability
they will just lie in the story now if they have
two consecutive press brief press briefings then it's important that they either
tell the truth or they lie in both press briefings if they

00:23
tell the truth once and lie the other time then it's going to be inconsistent
and it's going to be clear to everybody that the government is lying
and so in a mixed strategy we can accomplish that in a mixed strategy we can um
choose to to lie to tell an alternative fact twice or we can choose to um
tell the facts twice tell the truth and a behavior strategy
is not possible to mix only between or cannot mix only between those two
outcomes a behavior strategy will necessarily mix in also um
an inconsistent line now the reason why this happens or what goes wrong here
is that in this case player 1 forgets not whether they have taken an action

00:24
but which action they have taken and this brings us to the following
definition of perfect recall so perfect recall means essentially perfect memory
players don't forget anything in the game and we say that the game has perfect
recall if they don't forget whether they have already
taken an action so that was what we looked at before
and then the second condition here um says that essentially the path
from the root to any node x and any node x prime path from x 0 to x and x prime
um or if we have two nodes from the same information set x and x prime then

00:25
the same information sets are traversed on the path from the root to this
information set so in the same order and i have to choose the same actions along
both paths so this means that they don't forget
which actions that they have taken but they also don't forget
any other actions that have been taken by other players such as
their opponents but also nature's moves this means players don't forget the move
any other player has made or they themselves have made
and so another way to say it is that their information sets do not get
coarser so they don't forget anything that have known at an earlier point in
time and the main theorem of this video kuhn's theorem says that if
player i has perfect or call in an extensive form game
then every behavior strategy has the realization equivalent mixed strategy

00:26
and vice versa so this means yeah that we will be able
to use this equivalence for the construction or the existence proof of
sub-game imperfect equilibrium and it means that for all those games where
players are not forgetful we can always choose the methodologically simpler
behavior strategies so why are behavior strategies simpler well
one of them are is that they're more in line with the dynamic
game um players mix sequentially um whenever it's their decision rather than
once at the beginning of the game and like i've mentioned um last week in class
they're also computationally simpler because um
we can parameterize them with much fewer strategies then we can make strategies
and the reason here is that in mixed strategies we have to mix at the
beginning of the game for all the possible information sets that we could have

00:27
of all the possible mixing that we need but in
behavior standards we only need for each information set once essentially good
let's see the proof of it i mean half of it we've already seen
the case where for a behavior strategy there exists a realization equivalent
mixed strategy now the other half of the proof is
actually quite a bit simpler than the previous one so
what we do here is we start with um with a mixed strategy and we try to
define a realization call and behavior strategy so so we start with
a mixture of pure strategies and perfect recall implies that the same

00:28
the set of strategies that lead to two nodes in the same information set
the sets of pure strategies that lead to those nodes have to be the same
because along the path from the root to these nodes they travel through the same
information sets in the same order in that case the probability
with which player i takes the right actions
for the for play to reach x coincides with the right actions or the
probability that the right actions are taken to reach x prime because it's the
same actions that have to be taken so this means that the probability
with which it informat which put any node in information that is reached does
not depend on the node and we can use this to define our row ihi
as the probability that the right actions are taken for play to reach
information set h i and now we can define a behavior strategy by

00:29
dividing here by the probability with which information that h i is reached
so as i've mentioned before here the mixed strategy captures the probabilities
with which the different pure strategies choose action ai and all in all
this is a distribution over um all possible actions that are
available at i information set hi and so we can do this if
information that hi has reached a positive probability and if it's not a
reasonable positive probability we can let it be an arbitrary mixed action at
that information set and then we have to show that they are
realization equivalent again for node x we look at the sequence
um at the path from the root to x and denoted by x i k to x i m i and

00:30
we denote by h i k the corresponding information sets now
what we have to compare is or whether these player specific
probabilities are the same for the mixed strategy and the behavior strategy now
for the behavior strategy this was given by the product
that all the right decisions are taken along the path
so let's first see if we can simplify this the probability with which
the right action is taken at some information set h i
k so the first thing we note that the right decision taken at x i k to reach x
is the same as the right decision taken to reach the next node in the sequence

00:31
now here we can plug in the definition of our behavior strategy and then
we can use the fact that all the pure strategies um that take the right decision
for node x i k plus one to be reached are precisely all those pure strategies
for which x i k plus 1 leads on the path and
if you remember this summation here for mixed strategies was precisely
the probability with which all the right decisions are taken for play to reach x
i k plus one and the denominator here this is the same as
any x i k in information set h i k and then in order to
re-express the probability with which all the right decisions are taken in the
behavior strategy for play to reach x the definition here was it was this
product now each term of this product is given

00:32
by this ratio here and we see that this is a telescopic product so for each term
we will see that the numerator will cancel with the denominator of the next term
so precisely two terms remain the very last one which is
the probability with which node x is reached and
divided by one which is the probability that player i takes the right decision
for player i's first information set to be reached
but since player i doesn't take any decisions before their first information
set that probability is one so we see that indeed this definition
gives us a realization equivalent behavior strategy good now that we know this
that we know that in any game of perfect or call a
mixed strategy has a realization equivalent behavior strategy

00:33
we can prove existence of game perfect equilibria in behavior strategies and
precisely we do this in games with perfect recall now
the logic of the proof is exactly how we find sub-game perfect equilibria
backwards through the tree so we denote by gk all the
all the proper sub games of the game that contain k strict subgames and
this means that the smaller sub games are in g0
um because they don't have any other strict subgames we can just find a mixed
nash equilibrium in the subgame and then by coons theorem transform
this into a nash equilibrium in behavior strategies now for the inductive step
we assume that every sub-game in the set gk
has a sub-imperfect equilibrium and then we want to show that any sub game in

00:34
this larger set also has a sub game perfect equilibrium
so the way we do this is we start with any nash equilibrium in the game we know
that it exists in make strategies and what we want to do here is we look at
all nodes in the sub game so first so x x star here are all the nodes in
the sub game that we look at x s are all the nodes
that start strict subgames and then xs prime are all those notes
that start maximal sub games off the path
to this condition here means that there are maximal sub games not contained in
any other sub game and the first condition is that they are off the path
now from last week we know that we only need to refine sigma here off the path

00:35
now yeah we choose for all those maximal subgames off the path we choose
a continuation sub imperfect equilibrium and everywhere else we keep the nash
equilibrium and we want to verify that this is
indeed sub-game perfect while on the path we already know that nash
equilibrium is optimal and then the restriction to any subgame
is also nash equilibrium either by the definition of a subgame perfect
equilibrium right so on the continuation game in the maximal sub games
we have a stop game perfect equilibrium which means that in any
sub game of those sub games so in any non-maximal sub game
it's a nash equilibrium by definition of a subgame perfect equilibrium
and then on the path it's or the optimal because the nash equilibrium is optimal

00:36
and so sigma hat is indeed a subject in perfect equilibrium in the
game that starts here and then um yeah that's that's already the proof good so
yeah proof heavy video but um i hope it was instructed then
what have we seen that well mixed and behavior strategies aren't always the
same so if players forget that they've already taken an action then there are
behavior strategies without realization equivalent mixed strategies
and if players forget the information they have once had such as their own
move opponents moves or nature's moves then there are mixed strategies without
realization equivalent behavior strategies
in the class we will look at an example of imperfect recall and see how we can

00:37
find mixed as well as um behavior nash equilibrium
yeah so when do we actually use games with imperfect recall well there's
two reasons why we might want to study this the first one is if we look at
games with bounded rationality if we say okay we simply don't have the
cognitive power to remember everything in an infinitely long game
and then we can study bounded rationality by imposing that
they have bounded recall another application is if we have
repeated games with private information then
perfect memory actually makes it more difficult to find equilibrium
and in that case it might be we might want to simplify the model by imposing
boundary recall on the players good that's it
there's some questions for you to answer about

00:38
mixed behavior strategies and perfect recall and the literature
again this topic is covered in any game theory textbook and the original paper
that introduced it was by alright that's it for this video and
i'll see you in the next one
