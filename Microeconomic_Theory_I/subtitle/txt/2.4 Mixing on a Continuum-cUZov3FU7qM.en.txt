lastly we want to look at mixed strategy in ash equilibrium when players have a
continuum of actions available and this is particularly important if there is no
pure strategy in ash equilibrium such as in the three player hotel in game
now to walk you through the ideas behind how we find these nash equilibria
i want to start with an example that is simpler than the three-player hotel in
game i want to start with a bertrand competition among two players
in a bertrand competition two competing firms compete on prices
rather than quantities and the typical example would be
two gas stations now we've already argued through the hoteling model that
gas stations always set up shop next to each other so the only thing that we
consider when we go to a gas station given that they are at the same location
is which one has the lower price and we will then go to whichever gas station

00:01
has a lower price and we will suppose that all the customers do that
and there's a unit demand of customers and the caveat here is that each gas
station has only enough capacity has only enough gas to serve two thirds of
the demand now for simplest for simplicity of notation we'll assume that both
gas stations have the same unit cost normalized to zero
now the cost in reality is not zero but we could then simply replace
the interval of prices that the players can choose by setting it to the um
the cost the unit cost then the upper bound is standard unit cost plus some
constant and the reason why there is an upper
bound to the prices that the players can set
is so that we have existence of a nash equilibrium from the from the unmasking

00:02
but in reality nobody is willing to pay an infinite
amount right so there will be some upper
bound where we just say well i don't use cars anymore so there's a natural upper
bound where that exceeds the willingness to pay off customers
now what do the payoffs look like in this example here well okay if
both gas stations choose the same price they will each serve half of the
customers so they get half times the price at which they sell the gas
if they have a lower price they will get to serve two thirds of the demand which
is their capacity at their price and if they choose the
higher price they can serve one third of the demand and like i mentioned
in this example we can apply the theorem by das gupta and masking because the
sum of utilities is upper semicontinuous and the discontinued discontinuities in

00:03
each gas station's utility function are sufficiently nice for the theorem to
apply now let's see first why there exists no pure strategy nash equilibrium
so if we draw so if we fix a price set by the second gas station and
then we draw the best or the utility function that
the first gas station gets in any response we'll get these images here so
if we choose the same price as the other gas station
then we simply serve half the demand and so the utility rate will be half of the
price that we choose if we choose anything less
then we serve two thirds of the demand so here we have a slope
two thirds and anything above we have a slope of one-third and we see that
if we decide to sell one to sell at a price one
then we'll always only serve one-third of demand but we'll always

00:04
earn the maximal price that we can earn so we will always get one third
if we choose one and is that a best response well it depends if
the other gas station chooses efficiently low price
then we will this will be a best response but if they choose a higher
price or a sufficiently high price then it would be a better response to
undercut the price by the other company slightly
so there was some threshold in between where choosing one
is no longer a best response because there is a better response but no best
response so if we look at the best response
correspondence then we can figure out that the cutoff will be one half so
for any price set by the competition below one
half our best response will be one and if they set the price above one half

00:05
there's no best response now verifying consistency in this case is
rather easy the only possible best response is one
but if one of the companies sets their price equal to one the other one does
not have the best response so there is no pure strategy nash equilibrium
this means we want to look at mixed strategies now in this example
the strategy space is an interval and in general if we have
a an interval or a one-dimensional set of strategies available we can
represent mixed strategies or distributions through a distribution function
and so let me go a little bit in detail about
distribution functions so we will have an easier time finding these mixed
strategy nash equilibrium so in general a distribution function is
a function with three properties it's always non-decreasing because

00:06
we will always measure the probability of a larger set right if x increases then
this is a more likely event so it cannot decrease as x increases
then it's right continuous right continuous means similar to upper
semicontinuity or lower semi-continuity it means here that the limit point as we
approach a discontinuity from the right is the same as the
function value at that point the reason why it's right continuous is
because we have a weak inequality here this means that at this point we include
all the probability with which the random variable x takes exactly that value
and then lastly the distribution function starts at zero
so if you go sufficiently far to the left it will be zero and if it goes
sufficiently far to the right it will be one
now these two conditions together with monotonicity imply that any value in

00:07
between also has values between zero and one now if we look at a distribution
function it might look something like this it must not be continuous or it
it's possible that it's not continuous and at a discontinuity
well what is a discontinuity the left limit here is the probability
that x is strictly smaller than x the function value
is the probability that it's less than or equal to x so the
difference here is precisely the probability with which the random
variable is equal to this value x and in terms of the distribution
function we can write this probability as
the difference between the distribution function which is the value here
minus its left limit and we use this notation here f x minus
to indicate the left limit at x and the left limit always exists because

00:08
we have monotonicity and we call it discontinuity in a
distribution function an atom and an atom is precisely a point that can be
reached or that can be realized with positive probability all
the others are realized with probability 0 because if the left limit is equal to
the function value then the probability with which x is
equal to exactly one value will then be zero now there are two special cases of
distribution functions which with which you are quite familiar the first one is
continuous distribution functions which all admit a density function
so the density function is essentially the derivative of the distribution
function and we can use the density function to well compute
the probability that a value is smaller equal than x simply by integrating it

00:09
from minus infinity to x or more usefully actually to compute the
expected value of any function of the random variable x so we multiply
each possible value that can be realized with its density with which the with
which it is realized and so the interpretation of a density here is that
in a continuous random variable each value has is realized with probability zero
but the density function here shows us how the relative likelihood between two
possible values changes so for example this cell here is twice as likely as
this value here because the density is twice as high that's why in the
expectation we value or we count we weigh this value here or the function
at this point twice as high as whatever g of x the value takes at this point
here now another special case that you're all familiar

00:10
with are discrete random variables as if we roll a die or we throw a coin or
something like that and for discrete random variables we have a
probability mass function so in that case there are a few
possible outcomes that all have a positive probability like if we roll a
die then the outcomes 1 through 6 are all possible with probability 1 6.
and so here these green bars here indicate the probability mass functions
and are precisely the probability with which this
this value is realized which is the difference or this the size of the
discontinuity of the distribution function now for those
discrete random variables we can compute the expected value of g of x by
again weighing each possible outcome with the probability with which it happens
now which of the two should we use for mixed strategies

00:11
the answer unfortunately is neither because the mixed strategy is endogenous
it's chosen by the players and so we cannot really restrict the players to
choose a mixed strategy with a density or to
choose a mixed strategy that that is discrete um
since it's the player's free choice they could choose anything that is neither
continuous nor nor discrete now this is different from
if we have exogenous random events if we have exogenous random events in our
model then we typically want to assume they have a density function because
that will make the model nicer the reason why it's not okay to assume it for
for the player's behavior is because it's endogenous and it's hard to verify
whether it's satisfied in practice if somebody tells you oh and we assume
that you will mix with a density function then
how can you make sure that this is really a valid assumption whereas if it
is for exogenous variables let's say the rainfall is distributed according to

00:12
this density then this is something we can test because we have data detested
so in general the players will choose a mixed strategy will
or a mixed strategy will have both components we'll have continuous
components and discontinuous components but the good news is that
general random variables are not that different from discrete or continuous so
here we can look at the discontinuous part so we can look at all the values that
happen with positive probability at all the atoms of the distribution function
so here df are all discontinuities of f so those are all the atoms and atom x
happens with probability p of x which is the size of the discontinuity
then if we subtract the discontinuities from the distribution function what we

00:13
are left with is a continuous function which admits a density and
so we can decompose any distribution function into a continuous part with a
density and a discontinuous compound this continuous part with a probability
mass function and if we compute the expected value of a
random variable or a function of a random variable then well the way that
we would write it down is we would write it as
the integral over g of x times df of x so df here simply means
the rate at which the prop at which the distribution function changes
and the rate at which it changes is either the probability mass function if
there is an atom or the density function if there is no atom and so
really in general a distribution function is just given by a continuous
and the discontinuous random variable we just add them both together
now let's go back to our example and let's go back to

00:14
mixed strategies what does this mean for
mixed strategies well we can decompose a mixed strategy into its atoms so those
are those actions that are chosen with positive probability
and then all the remaining actions which are chosen with probability zero
but for those we can specify a density which tells us you know the relative
likelihood with which the other actions are chosen so here
this action here it looks like it's about two-thirds is chosen with probability
forty percent and then with 60 some other outcome is chosen and the
density specifies all the other outcomes are chosen with equal likelihood
now what does the best response here look like of the
first gas station well if we compute the expected utility then we'll
get something like this and we see we still have a discontinuity and
as a consequence the best response correspondence is still empty

00:15
this shouldn't come as a surprise because the whole problem here
why pure strategy equilibrium did not exist this are these discontinuities and
the discontinuities don't disappear if the distribu if the mixed strategy still
has atoms because the the relevant part here is that if
firm 2 chooses this value here with positive probability then there's always
a positive value of undercutting so if we don't have a pure surge in ash
equilibrium then most often we can only get a mixed nash equilibrium that is
actually atomless so most often we will find
a mixed nash equilibrium with a density function now
i want to solve this example in two ways i want to solve this example first

00:16
without assuming anything about the distribution and see how we can
find the equilibrium and then i want to start with some educated guess
about what the equilibrium could look like and then verify that it is an
equilibrium so first to simplify the notation or actually to make it
tractable we want to look at symmetric nash equilibria why is this a good idea
well if we have if both gas stations choose the same mixed strategy
then we will have fewer degrees of freedom so we only have one
distribution function to find instead of two so that's always a good starting
point and then in a mixed strategy players have to be indifferent between
all the possible values in the support between all the values that can be
realized and so we want to use the indifference principle for any

00:17
point for any price in the support of the mixed strategy all right let's assume
player 2 plays according to this mixed strategy f and
we now want to use the indifference principle
to find some condition on f and the difference principle tells us any price
in the support has to yield the same utility to the first gas station
so the first step here will be to calculate the expected utility so
well we serve two thirds of the demand if we choose a lower price
we serve half the demand if we choose the same price and a third of demand if
we choose a larger price and now we can express these probabilities
using the distribution function so this one here is that
p2 is strictly larger than p1 so this is 1 minus the distribution function then

00:18
here we know that this is the size of the discontinuity at p1
and then here this will be the probability that p2 is strictly
smaller than p1 so this is the left limit of the distribution function
right so one minus probability that's larger the size of the discontinuity the
probability that it's equal and then the left limit the probability that it's
strictly smaller than p one now we can combine some terms here so
here we see we have two minus two thirds f plus one half f so this means that
we're left with minus one sixth p f then also here we see we have one third
the left limit minus one half times the left limit so we get um
so it simplifies to these expressions now this is the expected uot for utility
for any p1 in the support and we know that they all have to be the same
so they all have to be equal to some constant and

00:19
to actually simplify this let's say this is a constant k
third so we can multiply everything by three and get rid of some of these
denominators then if we solve the resulting equation so
k over 3 is equal to this we multiply both sides by 3
and then solve for this expression here this is the quantity that we get
now why do i solve for one half times the distribution function plus this left
limit well because at any point that is not an atom
i will get precisely the distribution function here on the left hand side
because if there's no atom if there's no discontinuity then the left limit is
equal to the function value so this is summarized here at the
continuity point of the distribution function the distribution function has
to take this value what about added discontinuity okay from

00:20
the previous slide at a discontinuity this has to be satisfied
but then we can use the fact that at the left limit so as we approach
this price p1 as we approach discontinuity from the left we approach
it continuously because left limits exist so for all those points where we
approach p1 we can use the form that we have already
derived so we'll look at the limit as we come and approach p1 from the left
but now this function here over which we take the limit is
continuous so we take the limit by simply plugging in p1 and
this is the expression that we obtain and it has the same solution
so even at a discontinuity it has the same value in particular it does not
have a discontinuity so this indeed an atomless distribution
so we're almost there we know what the distribution function

00:21
looks like on its support but we don't know yet what the support is
but we do know one thing about the support we know that at the upper end
point so the largest possible price that players are willing to choose
the distribution function is one so let's denote by p bar
this largest point in the support the distribution function is 1
which means that p bar has to be equal to k so that this
term here is 1 and then 2 minus 1 is 1. so k is exactly equal to p bar
let's plug this in in the expected utility so at p bar one
well it's in the support so we will get k third that's how we chose
k so this is p bar third now we have argued previously that
we can always get one third if we choose one
so if p bar was anything less than one then there would be a profitable

00:22
deviation to choose 1 instead right so we know that we can always get
1 by choosing p1 and we can always get 1 3 by choosing price 1
so it's not possible that p bar is smaller than 1 so p bar has to be one
so we are mixing all the way up to the largest possible price
so this means that k is also equal to one and so now we know the distribution
function on its entire support we don't know yet what the lower bound
of the support is well this function here will get smaller and smaller
the smaller p1 gets and at some point it will become negative which is not
possible so this means that the lower bound of the support must be where the
function is zero and we can solve this to be one half and so
the symmetric mixed strategy nash equilibrium takes the following value

00:23
here or the list of the following mixing probabilities and
the expected utility is constant as it has to be in its entire support and then
below it it's simply with slope two-thirds then what's the
the mixing probability well if we want to display the density then
we take the derivative and um it'll be the following one so we actually assign
much more weight to two smaller prices and then decreases quadratically to um
i think that's probably around 1 8. so not too bad we were able to find it it
was a little bit tricky with the left limits and things like that
so now let's think about a different way how we can solve it that might be

00:24
somewhat simpler and to do that let's compare the support here of the mixed nash
equilibrium to some of the um pure strategy best responses um
so here this is actually the wrong way so there are none if the pui is
larger than one half so but from the pure strategy
best response analysis we know that the only possible best response is one
and one is indeed the upper limit of the support and then in the entire region
where there is no um pure strategy best response is
essentially where we have to mix so whenever there is no um
no best response in pure strategies is where we find the mixed equilibrium and

00:25
we might have been able to guess this so we could have guessed that the
distribution function is atomless because we argued that
most likely it will be atomless because for any atom will still have a
downward discontinuity and we could have guessed that the upper bound of the
support is one because that's the only possible pure strategy best response
so now if this was our guess how much faster would the derivation
have been well let's see if we compute the expected utility
well if it's atomless then one term will not appear which is
where we choose the same price as our competitor because that
happens with probability zero if it's atomless
and also the left limit will not appear separately because if it's atomless the
left limit is equal to the function value
all right this equation is much simpler we can immediately solve it for fp and
immediately get that this is the function value

00:26
and if we guess the upper bound of the support is one then again we plug in one
here and we obtain k is one and we're done so verifying
a mixed nash equilibrium can be very quick if we have a good idea what it
could be and in many cases we have a good idea when there is no pure strategy
nash equilibrium we have a guess that is animals and
sometimes we have a guess about what the support could be
so two approaches to finding strategy nash equilibria the first one
was the one on slides 53-55 we start with the general
distribution function we will see a difference principle for every pure
action the support and then we have to characterize the distribution function
separately for atoms and non-atoms and hopefully find that there are no atoms
then we plug in an unknown upper bound of the support where the

00:27
distribution function is equal to one and then hopefully get some expression
for distribution function now this approach here works
only for very few examples i only know two examples for which it works so
nicely one of them you've already seen the other one will be in in an
assignment um the other approach works more generally the problem is that
we need a good guess for it so guess the support justify
that it could be atomless and then we simply use the indifference principle
for this guest support and then we have to verify the end then
it is in the international equilibrium and this approach works surprisingly
well it sounds maybe you know guessing sounds not like a very
good recipe but let's go back to the three vendors on the beach
what could our best guess be well there's only one possible choice

00:28
where two players set up shop for which the best response correspondence of the
third player is continuous and this is if the two players um play
one fourth and three a one fourth and three quarters and
so we could have a guess that this is the support moreover we can guess that
that it will be atomless because the discontinuities were a big problem
and so we can assume that the strategy admits a density function
on this interval and then see if we can find a mixed generation equilibrium
and the reason why here it's important to assume the density function or and not
just the distribution function is because we can't calculate the expected
utilities only from the distribution function without the density
and it turns out that this is true it turns out that there is such a mixed

00:29
strategy nash equilibrium and if you want you can try to find it as practice
good so this week we've looked at nash equilibria
the most important solution concept in game theory but
i didn't choose it as the main concept of this week's class
and this shows how important really mutual best responses are so
if players are rational and their conjectures are correct
then they will play mutual best responses and we can find those
by finding the best response correspondence for the different
different players and then verifying consistency
the reason why i think this is more important than nash equilibrium is
because nash equilibrium is only one special case it's only
the neutral best responses in a static game with complete information
but all the other equilibria that we will look at will also be mutual best
responses so the single most important concept in the
entire class is finding these best response correspondences and verifying

00:30
the consistency now some other concepts that we've seen
the indifference principle again and it can be useful in two ways
it can be useful if we have a given strategy profile and we want to verify
that it is an equilibrium and it can be very helpful to find mixed
strategy in ash equilibrium in games where players have a continuum of actions
now i want to emphasize what is the most important part about this week's class
it's finding nash equilibria in finite games
and when we have concave utilities this will be the case that happens way most
by far the most frequently and it's the one that you absolutely need to know
then even though this video here i spent a lot of time talking about make
strategy nash equilibria it's really only relevant if you go for that a plus um
yeah so really the most important parts are finding ash

00:31
equivalent if players have finitely many actions concrete utilities or a
combination one player has finitely many the other one has concrete futilities
good no questions about this video either but some additional literature
a lot of this was about probability theory and so i thought i'll give you
two references for probability klenke is a good introductory textbook
and they just had a third edition last year
and then callenberg is sort of the the reference work if you ever do research
in probability that's the book you want to look at and again there was just a
new edition this year and then the the other
literatures or hotelings game again then shocket actually solved um
the or found the mixture of gina clear in the hotel in game
but the approach how to find it without guessing it is extremely difficult so

00:32
you can have a look at the paper if you want to see how he does it
and then i took the example of the bertrand competition from lecture notes
by azu osterglass good that's it for this week's videos and
i'll see you on wednesday in class
