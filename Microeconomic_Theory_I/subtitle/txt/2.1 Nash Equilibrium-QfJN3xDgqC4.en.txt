hello everyone and welcome back to micro
one this week's class will be about nash equilibria the most important solution
concept in game theory now let's see what all the fuss is about
so last week we have looked at this example where a pedestrian and a driver
want to cross an intersection at the same time
the pure strategies that the players have available are crossing the
intersection or waiting we have used these payoff matrices to
represent the player's utilities in each of the outcomes
and we see we have two good outcomes where one of the player waits and the
other one crosses then we have one particularly bad
outcome where both try to cross at the same time and then there is an accident
now last week we have introduced two solution concepts but neither is
satisfactory to analyze this problem here
the first one that we've looked at was a dominant strategy equilibrium but the

00:01
problem is that it doesn't exist in this example because the players don't have
any dominant strategies the other solution concept that we have
looked at was rationalizability and here we have kind of the opposite
problem that every strategy profile is rationalizable even the bad outcome
where both players try to cross the intersection at the same time
now the reason why this is rationalizable is because it's justified
by the conjectures that the other players will wait and we see here that
in this strategy profile with these conjectures we have a case where
the player's conjectures are completely wrong
right we believe the other one will wait with certainty when in fact they will
cross with certainty now this means that in this solution
concept the players have what is known as exposed regret after the fact they
both wish they would have deviated now from conceptual point of view

00:02
there's something unsettling about using a solution concept for these games
where the players conjectures can be completely wrong right our players here
are perfectly rational they are able to make
infinitely many logical deductions but then we allow the players to be
completely wrong with their beliefs and to fix this um
we will look at nash equilibrium in a nash equilibrium what we additionally
impose is that the player's conjectures are correct so sort of the other extreme
and then we arrive at the following definition here so in a nash equilibrium
no player has an incentive to deviate so a nash equilibrium is a strategy
profile so that for every possible deviation that player i could consider
the deviation will not make them better off so this means that

00:03
strategy sigma i is a best response given the correct conjecture that the other
players play sigma minus i and so since this holds true for every
player it means that nobody has an incentive to deviate now if you break this
definition down there are two components to this one the first one is that
compared to the best responses that we had last week the expectation operator
here is missing because the beliefs about the opponent's
strategies are correct right so this is the first
assumption here in the nash equilibrium players correctly predict the behavior
of the others and then the second condition is that players are rational
which means that they best respond to their conjecture and this one is simply
satisfied by the assumption of rationality the first requirement is a
rather strong requirement and yeah i think that we can now appreciate

00:04
how strong this requirement is because we spend so much time to analyze
rationalizable strategies right conjectures there could be so many
conjectures and they could be relatively complicated
but here we assume the players are correct in their conjectures with
probability one and this is really a strong requirement a strong condition
now why do we study nash equilibria if it relies on such a strong assumption
well like i mentioned um it is sort of the the weakest solution
concept does that does not allow exposed regret
right and we can only get that if the player's beliefs are correct and
from a more pragmatic perspective if the player's predictions are correct
then we get a very tractable theory we don't have to
think about conjectures at all because the conjecture is correct
but it's important to keep in mind what we have assumed

00:05
right so rationalizable strategies is anything that we could expect to happen um
of players with common knowledge of rationality we could
potentially see a crash right we could see that two players cross the
intersection at the same time it's not that this is not possible um but the
nash equilibrium just means that it's a strategy profile where nobody
would want to deviate if they knew the others
the other players strategies and so in nash equilibrium this crash cannot
happen anymore um but but it's sort of the other extreme right where where
even if we knew our important strategies we would not want to deviate
now whether or not this is a justifiable assumption depends really on
yeah how easy it is for players to predict the opponent's strategy and only
then should we interpret the nash equilibria as a prediction
but at the end of this video i want to talk more about precisely when we can

00:06
consider nash equilibria to be a prediction
for now let's first see how we find nash equilibria in these finite games
so first we look at pure strategy nash equilibrium and
those are relatively simple to find for each
strategy profile of player ice opponent we find the best responses by player i
so this means here if we find the best response for player 1 we first look at
let's say a fixed strategy by player 2 so let's say cross
and we see that the best response is to wait and if we fix
player 2 strategy to be waiting then player 1's best respond is to cross and
so those are our fewer strategy best responses now by symmetry
the driver has the same best responses and then we have
a two mutual best responses which are the pure strategy nash equilibrium

00:07
and we notice that both players correctly predict each
other's behavior and they best respond to it
now to find mixed nash equilibria there will be two ways how we can do it
the first one relates back to what we've
seen last week which is the indifference principle so
last week already i think it was lemma 1.9 we've seen that
if a player is willing to mix as a best response then they must be
indifferent between all the pure strategies in the support
if they were not they would be better off um
not playing the worst strategy among those that they are playing with
positive probability and so this is simply a special case
from lemma 1.9 where now the conjectures are correct
now it's important to keep in mind what the indifference principle says it says

00:08
that a player is indifferent between all pure strategies in the support so only
between those that they choose with positive probability and so
the indifference principle is only helpful to find equilibria if we know
the support now there's one special case
where we do know the support which is if there's two
actions by the players and then we can find completely mixed equilibria using
the indifference principle and a completely mixed equilibrium is one in
which positive weight is assigned to every pure action so let's see this in
the example of the intersection here so what we want to find is
we're going to use the indifference principle of let's say player one if
the opponent player two acts according to the nash equilibrium

00:09
and we don't know the nash equilibrium yet so we parametrize it with an
arbitrary parameter y it could be anything between zero and one
and now the indifference principle tells us that
the pedestrian should be indifferent between crossing and walking if the
driver crosses with probability y so let's compute the expected utilities
so for for weighting it's always zero and for crossing it's minus four
in the event that the driver crosses which happens with probability y so we
get minus four y from the first year from this outcome
and then we get plus one if the driver is waiting which happens with
probability one minus y and so in total we get an expected utility of one minus
five y now when are we indifferent precisely if y is one fifth
because the game is symmetric we see that the driver is

00:10
only indifferent if also but the pedestrian crosses with probability
one-fifth and for the driver to be willing to mix with
one-fifth it is necessary that the pedestrian also mixes with one-fifth
probability and so we have a unique completely mixed strategy nash equilibrium
now let me provide a warning about using the indifference principle and
we will see this in an example or an extension of the game where now we add
one additional action to both players where they can wave hi
to the other person in traffic and if the wave is not reciprocated then
you feel a little bit worse that you wave them but they ignored you so you
get minus epsilon and if they wave back at you we get plus epsilon now

00:11
we can see easily that the same nash equilibrium that we have found before
where both players cross with one fifth probability this is still a nash
equilibrium because if the opponent chooses only between c and w then responding
h cannot be better than than waiting right because
we get minus epsilon in both cases that happen in the nash equilibrium
so because waving is not in the support of our
opponent it cannot be a best response to choose to wave back
let's see what happens if we analyze this game using the indifference principle
so again we start by parametrizing the strategy of the opponent which we
don't know at the moment but we know we can write it as
choosing to cross with probability y choosing the weight with probability z
and then the remaining probability has to be assigned to waiting and waving now

00:12
the expected utilities for each pure strategy by the pedestrian
well if you wait this to zero because we always get zero for waiting
then if we cross well so if the driver crosses
with probability y we get minus four y but if the driver doesn't cross then we
get one and this happens with probability one minus y and if we cross
it doesn't matter whether the opponent is waving or not and so we get exactly
the same expected utility as before and then the expected utility for waving
high is well minus epsilon if they don't reciprocate and plus epsilon if they do
well knowing difference between the two before is the same as previously so it's
still with one fifth we should cross and the difference between waving high
and weighting um means that y plus c has to be equal to one half so that both

00:13
the positive and the negative epsilon are weighted with the same probabilities
and this means that z has be three over ten and we get a completely mixed nash
equilibrium in which we cross the intersection with twenty percent
likelihood we wait with thirty percent likelihood and we wave to the other
person with fifty percent likelihood and we see that just by using this
approach we did not get the other mixed equilibrium that we know exists
and this is because we have assumed that players are
indifferent between all three actions but yeah so this as a warning that the
indifference principle only works if we know the support of the player's actions
good now if the indifference principle only works if we know the support is
there a way how we can find nash equilibria without first knowing the

00:14
support and the answer is yes and it works through best response correspondences
the idea is that instead of just using indifference we
first find the set of all possible best responses by player i to an arbitrary
strategy profile of player eyes opponents
so this is what this means here right is that
the best response attains this utility and so any strategy that attains
the maximal utility has to be a best response and we do that by
parameterizing the strategy profile of every player
and then we maximize the expected utility of player i with respect to i's
choice variables which are the probabilities with which i chooses each
pure action and then once you have found the best response correspondence for
each player then we check the best response correspondences

00:15
against each other to see when we have a mutual best response and
because a mutual best response is precisely nash equilibrium this
guarantees us to find all nash equilibria okay
this slide here makes it sound like it could be rather complicated to find
best response correspondences for any for any possible strategy profile of the
opponents but let's see how it looks like in the example of crossing the
intersection so we need to parametrize the entire
strategy profile so we have probability x the pedestrian crosses and the driver
crosses with probability y and then you expect the utility of
let's say the pedestrian is -4 in the outcome here which happens if
the pedestrian crosses and the driver crosses with probability x times y and
then the pedestrian gets one if they're the only one to cross and the driver

00:16
waits which happens with probability one minus y and then by symmetry
the expected utility of player two is similar
now how do we maximize this utility well
we take the derivative with respect to x and we see that the derivative does not
depend on x at all anymore and this is not a coincidence because
this is the expected utility and x was the probability with which we choose a
certain action so the expected utility will always be linear in x and after we
take the derivative we will always get a function that does not depend on x at
all so we can see that the best response will be well okay if y
is equal to one fifth then the derivative is zero so this means we
are indifferent and we already knew that from the difference principle
if y is smaller than one-fifth this quantity will be positive

00:17
so this means that with each that additional probability of crossing
increases our expected utility and so we get the best response at x
equals to one so we cross with certainty and then if y is smaller
no if y is larger than one-fifth then the derivative is negative and
hence the expected utility will be maximized at x equal to zero where we
wait with probability one now we can summarize this discussion by
writing down the best response correspondences like this and i like to
be rather explicit with these correspondences because it will help us verify
when they are consistent with each other now let's try to verify consistency and
it works by just going through those cases one by one and we can start with
either player let's say we start with the best responses of player one if

00:18
we're in the first case if y is smaller than one-fifth then we see that the best
response here is to cross with probability one
but now we go to the other side and we see okay if we cross with probability
one then we are in this case here which means player two best responds with
waiting for sure and then we go back to where we started
and we see okay y equals zero is consistent with what we started
so this means we have found a nash equilibrium next case
suppose y is equal to one fifth then we can't really say anything about what
player one would do but we can say something about what player two has to do
or we can say something about what player 1 does from player 2's best
response because player 2 has to be willing to mix right this means we
choose both actions with positive probability and this is the best
response only if player one if the pedestrian crosses with also

00:19
probability one-fifth and then for the same reason
y has to be equal to one-fifth and we see again it's consistent with what we
started with last case if the driver crosses with probability more
than 20 percent then the pedestrian will wait
and this will imply that the driver will cross with royalty one and
we get the last nash equilibrium and so this approach gave us all three
nash equilibrium and we didn't have to worry that we were missing any
now we can also represent this mutual best correspondence we can
represent this graphically so in this graph here we have along the x axis
player one's probability of crossing and on the y-axis the driver's probability

00:20
of crossing so we see here that if x if y is smaller than one-fifth then x is
equal to one so that's here then if y is equal to one-fifth anything is a best
response and if y is larger than one fifth then x equals zero is the best
response and similarly we get the same for player two
and then what's the mutual best response correspondence it's the intersection
points of well the best response correspondences
now graph this graphic approach really works well only if
both players have two actions available but the analytical approach always works
[Music] now in this example we have three nash
equilibria and they attain the payoffs one zero zero one and zero zero and
in general the problem with mixed actions in this example is that
if both players mix then they have to attach positive weight to

00:21
an accident which leads to a very low expected utility now
the two pure subdivision equilibria are pretty good in the sense that
they maximize the sum of the utilities the only drawback is that they
um give preference to one of the players and if we look at this graph here we
might want to be able to select those with some probability is there a
way how we can achieve an outcome that is symmetric is fair to both players but
is also efficient and the answer is yes we can use what is
known as a public correlation device so we can say
we can install a traffic light and we can say well
you should choose this nash equilibrium if the traffic light is red for the cars
and the other nash equilibrium if the traffic light is green for the cars and

00:22
this is a nash equilibrium because the signal that we see
is only a recommendation it's not binding if you see a red light
at the intersection then you don't have to wait it's just in your
best interest to wait because the cars will be driving through
and so this means that even if we see the signal
we can still both maximize our own actions right i i don't care about the
driver i don't even know the driver in fact um i guess unless i waved high
previously but um yeah i don't care i just maximized my
own utility but nevertheless it's in my interest to follow the recommendation of
the traffic light and let's say if the traffic light is
red and green equally likely then we will get this nice symmetric payoff in
which both players get one half expecting utility [Music] good to summarize
this video i want to discuss again about

00:23
what is a nash equilibrium and what is a nash equilibrium not so
i guess closest to the definition a nash
equilibrium is a set of outcomes that is consistent with mutually rational
behavior in which nobody's beliefs are exposed and validated so this means
nobody is completely wrong within their beliefs and players don't have exposed
regret and those are all outcomes that are consistent with these two
conditions that the players are rational and that they
they their conjectures are correct and so in a sense the set of all nash
equilibria could be viewed as the solution to the game
now could we use an individual nash equilibrium as a prediction and well
since i mentioned that in this class we want to pay
particular attention about what the underlying assumptions are we go back to

00:24
the underlying assumptions about nash equilibrium now the fact that
players are rational i think we are very comfortable with that assumption
but the other one is whether the conjecture whether the player is correctly
conjecturing each other's behavior whether that is reasonable
and only in that case should we use an individual nash equilibrium as a
prediction now we have seen one example last week where this is justifiable and
it's if a unique strategy profile survives rationalizability right in the corner
example we have seen that even without assuming anything about the
other players conjectures we can iteratively deduce their strategy and in
that case clearly it's justified that the player's predictions are correct then
today we've seen some other cases where correctly predicting each other's
behavior is reasonable let's say the first one is if there's

00:25
explicit communication if you and i talk with each other before
we play a game then we expect which nash equilibrium you will play
so we have seen on the traffic light right is
essentially explicit communication that tells who or which nash equilibrium
should be played and once the players know they have no incentive to deviate
now more broadly the law informs people how they are expected to behave and you
don't have to follow the law you can go to prison if you want but
it's not in your best interest to do so a contract
is written precisely in a way such that following the contract is a nash
equilibrium and this requires that the punishments
are sufficiently strong for either side if they breach it so that nobody has an
incentive to deviate [Music] another way how players predictions
could be correct is through some kind of evolutionary process

00:26
let's say if players if you play poker with the same opponent over and over
again then eventually you will learn with what probability they are bluffing
and things like that so if you've played them often enough
then you can adapt your strategy and they will adapt their strategy to
yours and then eventually play will reach a nash equilibrium where nobody
can improve their strategy anymore another example would be i
suppose rock paper scissors um if you played enough against one opponent then
you kind of can predict how they play i suppose also in biology here we have
this evolutionary nash equilibria where where
certain species adapt to to survive in a in a niche that other species don't use
and things like that and then in general if there is a focal
point for some reason so if there is some common expectation in society that

00:27
everybody behaves a certain way such as an example
social norms are upheld because we are all following them let's say
if you and i meet each other and we say hi then
this is kind of a nash equilibrium because we're both happier that we both
said hi than if we both don't say hi but this is just because of the social norm
if the social norm was that we don't say hi then we would be happy to not say hi
um yeah another example could be um if you are on the bike and you face somebody
else on the bike and then there are two nash equilibria where one
swerves left the other right no we're both swerve right or both swerve left
and because in taiwan people drive on the right side of the road it could be a
focal point to expect that people will swerve right [Music] good
that's it for the first video for nash equilibria in finite games and here's a

00:28
few questions for you to check how much you've understood
then the literature um well nash equilibrium is any gate is in any game
theory book and it was first derived by nash in 1950 in a one page paper good
that's it for this video and i'll see you in the next one
