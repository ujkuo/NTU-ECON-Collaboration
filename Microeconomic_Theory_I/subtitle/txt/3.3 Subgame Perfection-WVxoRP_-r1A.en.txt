finally we're getting to sub game perfection
as a motivating example for this video we're considering the beginning of a
financial crisis where one bank bank a has suffered large losses
bank a is liable to bank b owes bank b 1 billion us dollars but a total worth of
bank ace assets are only 800 million dollars
now the typical procedure would be that bank a declares bankruptcy and then
after bank a has been liquidated it repays whatever its assets are worth
to bank b and the problem is that bankruptcy is a very costly proceeding and
it will incur an additional losses of 200 million which means that in the end
bank a can repay bank b only 600 million dollars this implies that bank b has an

00:01
incentive to bail in bank a and renegotiate the debt claim with bank a
and say okay we're willing to accept the lower payment of 800 million dollars
and this of course prevents bank a from having to file bankruptcy
now this would be a very efficient liquidation of bank a and a very
efficient resolution of a financial crisis unfortunately this hasn't happened in
the global financial crisis 10 years ago 13 years ago wow it's been so long
the reason why it didn't happen is because the government is present
bank b would think well i'm not the only one interested in saving bank a
now if bank a declares bankruptcy this will cause large losses to the economy
and the government has an incentive to prevent that so the government has an
incentive to also rescue bank a and we can formulate this as a an

00:02
extensive form game where first bank b decides should i
rescue bank a with a bail in wait in which case it receives 800 million dollars
or should i not bail in bank a and then the government gets to
decide whether the government should bail out bank a or not
if it does not bail out bank 8 and there will be large losses to the economy
and if it does there will be some cost of the bailout and this is the
preferred outcome of bank b because its debtor is protected
now the reason why the government is modeled second here is because
the government is typically considered as the lender of last resort and so is
the the one who steps in at the end if nobody else has
now we can analyze this game with nash equilibria we transform the game into

00:03
the reduced strategic form and we see that there are two nash equilibria um
yeah i'm not sure why i didn't underline 0.8 here should also be
a so here is the best response and there are two pure strategy nash equilibria
where exactly one of the parties rescues bank a
and the problem with this is that one of the equilibria is not
consistent with backward induction it's the equilibrium in which bank b bails in
bank a and the government threatens not to bail out um bank a
problem is that this threat is not credible
given that the government gets to act choosing not to bail out bank a is
strictly suboptimal and we wanna we can rule this out already with backward
induction now let's change the game a little bit

00:04
let's add another creditor of bank a so there's now two banks that are hurt by
bank a's bankruptcy and bank b can decide to
to enter a bail in and if they enter a billion bank b and bank c essentially
play a matching pennies game for who pays for
the bankruptcy so they both flip a penny if both comes up head then bank c will
pay for it and if both come up tails as well and if they
are different the two pennies then bank b will pay for it
now as we mentioned here because we have this launching of an
information set we cannot apply backward induction
nevertheless we have an idea of what should happen because we know
that the matching pennies game has a unique nash equilibrium in which both

00:05
players makes 50 50. so we know that here in this continuation game
we should expect a nash equilibrium so we should expect
the 50-50 outcome and then we should be able to solve the rest of the game
and this is precisely the idea behind sub-game perfection
now the one additional requirement that we need is that
we only look at continuation games that are so called proper sub games and the
sub game is proper if no information set contains note both
nodes both from the sub game and its complement now this has two implications
first of all it means that the beginning of the continuation game the node x
is a singleton information set and it also means that if there is no nodes
within the subgame and outside the subgame in the same information set then

00:06
it means that it is common knowledge among the players
that they are playing the sub game and it seems a
useful restriction right if we want if we predict the behavior in the subgame
then it should not rely on anything outside the subgame
and this is precisely given here by the condition that it's a proper subgame
then a subgame perfect equilibrium is a strategy profile such that the
restriction to any proper subgame is a nash equilibrium
and it turns out that this is precisely the condition that we need to eliminate
non-credible threats um [Music] if there are non-signaling information sets
and we see if information is perfect then any node is in a singleton
information set so then any sub game or any continuation game is a proper sub

00:07
game and in that case we can find the sub game perfect equilibrium through
backward induction so indeed subcomperfection is an
extension of backward induction moreover subgame perfection is a
refinement of nash equilibrium because the entire game is a proper sub game
any sub imperfect equilibrium is a nash equilibrium and so
subpoena perfection is now the first time that we see um
where we see how we use equilibrium refinements so we say
that in these games that we have looked at there are too many nash equilibria
there are unreasonable nash equilibria and we want to
refine this prediction we want to make the set of predictions smaller by
imposing additional conditions and the additional condition that we impose is
that we don't want to have any non-credible threats those are threats of the
equilibrium path that wouldn't be carried out

00:08
if that information set was reached now let's go back to this example and
see how we can solve it with sub game perfection so we will see a useful
technique here called the dynamic programming principle
now if we want to solve this game then the right hand side is easy to
solve the government prefers to bail out and in the subgame we've argued that
there is a unique nash equilibrium in which both makes 50 50. now
what remains is to find the optimal response by bank b in the beginning and
to do that we can replace the entire sub game with the expected utility
that the players receive into continuation equilibrium so if they mix

00:09
50 50 then both bank c and bank b get 0.8 and
now that we have aggregated the payoffs it's clear that bank b prefers
not to go into a bail in because the government will bail out so this is
the expected outcome but now we have a solution concept that
gives us the expected outcome now let's look at a whole different application
subcamera affection was used to rationalize the behavior of the united
states and the soviet union during the cold war in an application called
nuclear returns so the idea is that the two superpowers are
at well in a cold war with each other and
if one country commits some provocative incident then
the other country can either choose to ignore it or escalate the incident the
problem is if they ignore it then they lose a little bit of face because

00:10
the other superpower has successfully committed some provocative incident
if they choose to escalate it then the super power who
committed the productive hint provocative incident they can either
back down and lose a lot of faith or they can start a nuclear war
and in the nuclear war the two countries can either retreat or attack
and if at least one country attacks then the utility for all these three
terminal payoffs here will be minus 99 for both country because the attack just
annihilates the entire globe now let's see what kind of subgame perfect
equilibria we can find in this game so we start at the end of the tree
with this the smallest possible sub game and we have to find the nash equilibria

00:11
so we transform it into a reduced form strategic game after we do that we
get two pure strategy nash equilibria where both retreat or both attack and it
turns out these are the only nash equilibria because if the other if
my opponent retreats with some positive probability then it's a strict best
response to retreat so the only possible way how we can have
in a war in equilibrium is if both attack with probability one so now
in this case there is no unique continuation
equilibrium in this game so what we have to do is we have to
go through both continuation equilibria and then see what it implies for the
behavior before the subgame so let's start with the

00:12
good continuation equilibrium where they both can't both countries retreat now
the superpower who committed the provocative incident
knows that if they start a nuclear war then they'll both retreat and this is
better than losing so much face because they both retreat so they both
lost a bit of phase so in that case it's better to go into the nuclear war
now anticipating this the slighted superpower one has an
incentive to not escalate the incident and just lose a tiny amount of phase
rather than experience all those um mustering costs that
going into a nuclear war and then retreating would entail so this happens if
the countries believe that they will retreat if there's a nuclear war
now what happens if in the nuclear war actually the two countries attack then

00:13
well then the continuation game of the war has such a low
utility so that country two does not want to go into it and then set back downs
backs down which means that the slightest superpower has an incentive to
escalate it and i guess this was the outcome in the cuban missile crisis
so how do the two equilibria differ well interesting is that
the difference between the two is about the expectation of the countries what
happens if a nuclear war was started even though the nuclear war is off the
path for in both equilibria and yeah so this illustrates again how
important it is that we require reasonable off-path beliefs or off-path
behavior because it can affect the incentives on the path now what does it mean

00:14
if we now look at the cuban missile crisis it means that it means that they
indeed expected that a nuclear war would start
if russia doesn't back down and that's why it was optimal for the us to
escalate it so let's try to write down a procedure
for finding subgame perfect equilibrium we go backwards through the tree
and we go through all the sub games starting with the smallest one then we
look at large and larger sub games and so we look at a set of
all nodes for which there is no um smaller subgame so we look at maximal
sub games and then for all those sub games we look at all possible continuation
equilibria in those subgames and then for each one of those we can replace the
terminal node with the expected utility that the players get in the continuation
equilibrium then we can transform the pruned version

00:15
of this game into its reduced strategic form find the national equilibrium as we
did in the static games transform it back to the
dynamic game find the equivalent behavior strategies
so overall this could be quite a lot of work if the game is large
but so in the games that we see typically in this class there'll be like
one or two steps and it's doable then as i've mentioned existence of something
perfect equilibria we'll look at next week but this week let's look at some
properties of sub-game perfect equilibria and we'll start with
the following property here that says when is a nash equilibrium necessarily
sub game perfect and this is the case if if anything is um on the path so

00:16
on the path a nash equilibrium is already optimal
and the reason is that there can't be any non-credible threats as long as the
node is reached with some positive probability in a nash equilibrium
players have to best respond already from that node on
and so really sub-complexion is only a refinement of behavior of the path
the consequence of this proposition here is that if we find
a nash equilibrium in completely mixed strategies
so that those are again mixed strategies where
every pure strategy is selected with positive probability or each action is
played with positive probability in that case everything is on the path and as a
consequence the nash equilibrium is already subgame perfect see the proof

00:17
because i think it's quite instructive so typically we set up the proof by
supposing that the contrary is true so we look at a nash equilibrium on
and we suppose that the restriction to a subgame that happens with positive
probability is not a nash equilibrium right so we look we suppose that there
exists a profitable deviation in some sub game that starts at node x now
what we have to do is we have to show this to a contradiction and the only
thing we can show it to a contradiction to is to show that then the nash
equilibrium or then sigma can't have been a nash equilibrium so what we need
to do is we need to find a profitable deviation for some player i
how can we find the deviation well we have a profitable deviation in a sub

00:18
game that happens with positive probability so the idea is that we use
this deviation in the sub game and we use this strategy without a deviation in
or outside of the sub game and this is precisely what we do we
define sigma tilde here to be the strategy that plays sigma i outside the
sub game and this profitable deviation in the sub game and the idea is because
the sub game is reached with positive probability this deviation matters also
in the entire game so how do sigma i and sigma tilde i differ
in the distribution over the game tree first outside the sub game they agree
because sigma tilde i and sigma i are the same
this means two things this means that the sub game is reached with the same
probability because all the actions leading to x are chosen

00:19
with the same probability under both strategies
and it also means that in terminal node outside of the sub game is reached with
the same probability because again the two strategies agree now let's show that
this strategy sigma tilde i here is a profitable deviation so we look at the
expected utility now because we only because we can only
make a statement about probabilities outside the sub-game we condition
whether or not we are in the sub-game and if it's outside we know
all the utilities are the same we know the sub game is reached with the
same probability here the only thing um that is not the same here is the
expected utility from reaching the sub gain but here we know that sigma tilde i
is identical to sigma hat so it leads to a higher expected utility

00:20
and so because the subgame is reached with positive probability
this improvement here matters and we get a profitable deviation to sigma i which
is a contradiction to the fact that sigma was a nash equilibrium okay
that's it for the finite strategy spaces let's look quickly at
what happens if we have a continuum of actions available
and let's go back to the competition between our two oil producers but this
time let's look at a stackelberg competition where let's say the opec countries
produce first and then the russian federation observes the amount of oil
that was produced and then they optimally respond so that we can compare
the results as easily as possible i again chose exactly the same
parameterization now what is different here is that

00:21
the second firm now gets to observe the quantity produced by the first firm and
we can write down an extensive form game with a continuum of actions using these
these arcs but this means here that there's
essentially a continuum of information sets and for each quantity observed
firm two can choose a different response okay we've already seen what the best
response should be by firm two um if it's an interior point it's 90 minus
q1 over two and if in if it's the boundary point then it's zero now if
firm anticipates this firm one anticipates this then
it will maximize the utility when we plug in q2 star here so if we recall in the
corner game we had we first solved for both best response

00:22
functions and then looked for a mutual best response but here it's
different right here first firm two or first we solve for firm two and then we
plug in the entire best response of firm two into firm one because this means
firm 1 anticipates the response all right we plug it in then we use the
fact that minus the maximum is the same as plus the minimum of
the negative quantity inside then we can move 90 minus q1 inside the
minimum to both of them and then we see that the minimum here
because this is q1 is chosen by firm 1 q1 will never choose something that is
larger than 90. so those two terms will always be positive and so the minimum
will always be 90 minus q1 over 2. and this means that the expected utility

00:23
for any quantity q1 given the optimal response by firm 2 is of this form here
and we differentiated find the best response
first order necessary condition tells us that it's 45 and
if we take the second order derivative then we see that indeed it's
strictly concave so 45 is indeed the maximum and
firm 2 will then best respond to 45 by producing 22.5 now we may wonder
how come that this outcome is different from the granola competition didn't we
say that any subgame perfect equilibrium is also a nash equilibrium
so how could we get anything other than the corner equilibrium
if that was the only nash equilibrium well the important part to note here is

00:24
that those are not the same games because here firm 2 has
many many more information sets right in the corner competition firm 2 can only
choose one action has only one information set but here they have a continuum of
information sets so 45 22.5 is not the equilibrium it's only the equilibrium
outcome the equilibrium itself is a decision by firm two for each possible
quantity that can be produced by firm one so this will be typical here in these
dynamic games with the continuum of actions that the best response will be a
function for all possible values that can be observed
and so it's not correct to say that this is the sub-game perfect equilibrium but
in fact this is the subgame perfect equilibrium
and the supreme perfect equilibrium is unique
a nash equilibrium however is not unique there are many nash equilibria actually

00:25
in the stackelberg game as an example we can get the corner
equilibrium as a nash equilibrium if we say that okay firm 2 best response
with 30 no matter what no matter what firm one does then
this is a nash equilibrium because firm two best response to firm one right q2
star the best response at 30 is 30. and given that firm 2 produces 30 firm
1's best response is to produce 30 as well
the problem is that the threat of always producing 30 is not credible
firmon knows that if they produce more firm2 will best respond by producing
less firm2 will not insist on selling 30 barrels of oil as well

00:26
yeah in fact we can sustain any rational outcome in a nash equilibrium
here because we can punish off path behavior so suppose you want to
support any quantity produced by firm1 then we can do that by saying okay firm2
will best respond on the path but off the path firm 2 will just flood
the market with oil so that it will yield to a negative utility for both firms
well what does this mean well it means that
firm two best response to firm one by construction but also firm one then best
response to firm two because deviating would be extremely costly to both firms
the problem again is that this threat here of completely flooding the market
is not credible and if we insist that there are no
non-credible threats then the unique equilibrium is

00:27
the subject and perfect equilibrium of the stockholder competition
another example of a game with a continuum of actions is the english auction
and i noticed that if i play videos that that are recorded
then youtube will monetize my my lecture videos and you'll have to wait through
ads i'm not actually going to play the video but if you click on it it'll take
you to a the video on youtube i guess and yeah for those of you who don't have
time to watch it it's an english auction
in futurama where everybody bids on this can of old anchovies and the
the last two bidding uh last two bids are 23 million by mom and then fry bids
over her by saying he wants to buy it for one jillion dollars

00:28
and we can phrase this english auction as a dynamic game where
the players alternate with bits and they can choose to either not bid anymore in
which case the other player gets the item or they can choose to bid
to make a strictly higher bid and then the utility at the end of the
game is simply the difference between how much they value
the item minus how much they bid if they win the auction
now this english auction here has a problem it has a problem that if mom has
made a bid then because fry has to choose a strictly larger bid it means that
the set of possible responses is not compact anymore and we know that this
can lead to little problems with existence of best responses

00:29
and this is exactly what we'll see here so suppose that mom bids some amount
then fry's possible responses are to either over bid mom or to not bid at all
so this should be yeah that's correct and well if mom bit higher than the
evaluation than fry's valuation then then it's no problem because in that case
fry is happy to not win the auction the problem is if she bids something smaller
then fry has no best response because no matter what he bids he would always be
slightly better off by under bidding or by bidding
over bidding mong by slightly less so there's no sub game perfect
equilibrium in this game and this should not come as a surprise because um
yeah because action sets are open after mom's bid

00:30
now next week we'll see existence of soccer and perfect equilibria in finite
games and this is one way how we could solve
the english auction we could discretize the set of all allowable bits
but this is somehow not a very not a very clean way because
depending on how fine we make the grid the more intractable it will become to
solve the auction what is much cleaner is that we say okay
we want an auction where the set of strategies of one player is not affected by
whatever the other player has chosen and one way to do it is to consider a
rising clock auction so in the auctioneer instead of asking
the bidders to bid themselves up they could simply have
a bidding curve or a price that goes up and up and up and
the bidders decide when to drop out of the auction if the price is too high

00:31
and in that case if they both drop out at the same time then there will be a
lot drawn to designed the winner and in that case the set of available you know
times to drop out does not depend on what the others do
so in that case the sub game perfect equilibrium will exist lastly
a perhaps surprising something perfect equilibrium in a
finite extensive form game you have two subgame perfect equilibria and
the surprising equilibrium is here the equilibrium to the left where we see that
firm 2 all firm 2. player 2 chooses left even though given that the information
set is reached right is strictly dominant the problem is that
overall this is only choosing right is only weakly dominant because

00:32
if player 1 2 says l then player 2 is indifferent between left or right so
this is a nash equilibrium and in this example here there's only one
proper sub game because subgames cannot cut through information sets so
if the entire game is the only sub game then all nash equilibria are necessarily
sub-game perfect equilibria and in three weeks we'll see how we can resolve
this issue yeah the reason why something perfection can't deal with it is
we can't look at just the game starting at this note here or at this note here
because here um player 2 knows player 1 chose right
which is information they don't have in the entire game so using the prediction
if player 2 has additional knowledge to trying to conclude what happens in

00:33
the entire game is not very useful and this is not a proper sub game because
player 2 here has less information they don't know the relative probability
between the two nodes which they do in the entire game depending on how
frequently player one chooses middle or right now so
this may be as a teaser for the future weeks why does stop imperfect some pecan
perfection not always work and we will find out why this is the case yeah
good so we have finally managed to combine backward
induction with nash equilibria and we have gotten this very nice solution
concept that is sub-game perfection and the way it refines nash equilibrium is
that it eliminates non-credible threat of the equilibrium path and yeah that's

00:34
it um i forgot to include sort of the most
important concept here and i would say it's that
players act sequentially rational which is that they look forward and
take into account what their opponents will do in the future so the most
important concept here is that we solve games backwards through the tree good
some more questions for you to practice sub game perfection and then
actually don't do this one it's maybe a bit too difficult
um well we'll deal with this next week i guess and
the literature here um reinhardt salton was the one who introduced something
perfection and won a nobel prize for it good that's it for this video i'll see
you in class
