so far we have looked at nash equilibria
only in games with finitely many actions in this video we want to see what
changes if players have a continuum of actions available
the standard example that we had last week for a continuum of action was a
cournot duopoly where the opec countries and the russian federation compete in a
global market for oil and this is the parameterization that we had
last week both players can produce any quantity at a unit cost of 10
units per barrel and then we had a linear price function
that starts at 100 and then linearly decreases with total supply
now in this game we have already derived the best response correspondence for

00:01
players pure action so if we are certain that our opponent plays
or produces a certain quantity then we best respond with this quantity here
and these there are conjectures how we call them the certainty that they play a
pure strategy can help us find pure strategy in ash equilibrium
so if we were to write this as a best response correspondence like we did for
the finite games it would look in this way
and we can verify now consistency in the same way as before by simply going
through all of these cases we can start again with any case that we
would like so let's say we start here if firm 2 produces more than 90 then
firm 1 will best respond with 0 then we see what happens if we plug in 0 then
from 2 should play 45 which is inconsistent with what we started with

00:02
so this is not a nash equilibrium in exactly the same way it's not
possible that firm 1 produces more than 90 and
then if both players or both firms produce less than 90 then we have a cis
system of two by two equations which has a unique solution where both
players produce 30. we've already seen this outcome as the
uniquely rationalizable outcome and it's no surprise that this is also a nash
equilibrium what i wanted to highlight here though is that nothing changes
in this approach where we first find the player's best response correspondences
and then we verify consistency this works no matter if players have finitely
many actions or they have a continuum of actions and it works even if let's say
one player has finitely many the other eight continuum of actions
and it also works in dynamic settings or games with incomplete information that
we will look at through the rest of the class so really all the equilibria that

00:03
we will look at in the entire class can be found using this procedure
so here is an example of a game where one firm firm one has a continuum of
actions available has to choose a pure quantity but can be anything between
zero and infinity and firm 2 can only choose 1 of 0 20 or 40
barrels of oil to produce but firm 2 here has the ability to mix and you can try
for yourself if you can solve this example i should be clear here this is
not part of the participation grade this is just for you to get additional
practice to solve through some of these examples
now in this case the corner game we have seen that
a nash equilibrium existed in pure strategy so that's sort of the best we
can hope for and that's not always the case now the

00:04
reason why it worked is very similar to why we were able to work only with
pure strategy conjectures is because we have this nice concavity
or if we think about it a little bit more carefully what we actually need is
quasi concavity now before we even look at the
mathematical definition let's look at the graph of a typical
quasi-concave function and it's a function that increases first
and then decreases and what this means is that there is a unique
maximum in a sense or put differently any local maximum so anything that we
could find with the first order necessary condition is actually a global maximum
now the formal definition here states that between any two points
the function value is higher than the smallest value of either at x or y
and so if x or y takes the same value then it means that any point in between

00:05
has to be larger or equal than this value and if they take different
values then it means well it's simply larger than the smaller of those
because it decreases down here to y so quasi-concavity here generalizes
concavity and quasi-concavity is sufficient for
local maxima to be global maximum we then have this existence theorem here
by debrew glicksberg and fan who have shown individually actually that
in a game where players have continuous actions but
the action sets are compact and convex such that players utility functions are
continuous not only in their own actions but also in everybody else's actions
and the utility function is quasi concave in players own utility

00:06
then the game has a nash equilibrium in pure strategies and so
that is sort of the best possible case we can hope for and
those are games that are extremely well behaved like the cournot wapoli where we
have as we have seen a unique nash equilibrium in pure strategies now
because this is so convenient to work with pure strategies we often try to
parameterize applications so that these conditions here are satisfied and if we
can find a parameterization of the model
that we're studying that satisfies these conditions then analyzing equilibria
will be much simpler than if it does not satisfy these conditions now
quasi-concavity the role of quasi-concavity in this
result here is like i mentioned that the first order necessary condition is
sufficient to find a global maximum let's

00:07
now discuss the other two assumptions so first we'll discuss
why the strategy space has to be compact and convex and what can go wrong if it
is not so for compactness there is a game the game of chicken that is frequently
analyzed by game theorists or analyzed i should say
used in classes as an example it was in a movie rebel without a cause
with james dean where two to james dean and another another actor in the film
they have this race where they race towards a cliff in their cars
and then they jump out of the cars and let the cars go over the cliff
and the goal of the game is to jump out as late as possible because if you jump
out first then you'll be a chicken if we parametrize this
as a game then we could say what are the players strategies well it's the time

00:08
they choose to jump out of the car there will be some fixed time t at which
they reach the cliff and they have to jump out at any time before they reach
the cliff once they reach the cliff it's
too late and they will go down the cliff with the car in this case we see that
the strategy space is not compact because it is
not closed and what can go wrong is that it's always a better response to wait
just a little longer so no matter how late the other guy jumps out of the car as
long as it's before t then i always have a best response to just jump out right
after him we see that the players can jump out later and later
and it suggests that the equilibrium should be the limit point
but the problem is the limit point is not included because at that time they
both go over the cliff so we see that in that case

00:09
we cannot have a nash equilibrium in the same sense if
the strategy space is not bounded then there might not be an equilibrium so if
there is no cliff ever then the guys would just drive on and on and on
and again there will be no equilibrium because they just
can always drive a little longer now to understand what can go wrong with
if continuity isn't satisfied let's look at an example of a beach vendor
or a model actually of two beach vendors who set up shop on a beach of unit
length and they can shed set up shop anywhere on the beach
then the beach goers are distributed uniformly and
they set up their space anywhere on the beach and then when they want something
to drink they will always go to the beach vendor who is closer to them

00:10
what does this mean for the utility functions that the players have well if
they set up shop here and here then this means that
the first vendor will get to sell to everybody on this side of the beach
and then to half of the customers between the two
and then the second vendor will get to sell to everybody on this side of the
beach and do half of them between those two
and so if we measure the utility of the beach vendors as sort of the measure of
or a fraction of people they sell to then x1 here will sell or
vendor 1 will sell all those serve all those customers so
vendor 1's utility is simply x1 plus x2 half whereas the second vendor will sell
the remaining ones so 1 minus x1 plus x2
and then we have to specify what happens if they both set up shop at the same

00:11
spot in which case they'll just get half off of the beach customers
because it's equally far to get to both vendors
and this is a discontinuous utility function if we draw it for some value of
x2 here then okay at the very end at zero if player one chooses a zero then
they split all those customers between them equally which means that
they get half of the distance here then the utility increases the closer
vendor 1 sets up shop to x2 until it's very close they set up shop very
close to x2 they get all the customers essentially on this side of the beach
the problem is that if they set up exactly at the same spot as x2 they only
get half the customers on the other hand if they set up shop on the other side

00:12
of vendor two they'll have a lower payoff and again it's decreasing the
further away they go because they serve a smaller fraction of the customers
now this discontinuity here will cause some problems for best responses because
the closer we get the better our response is but the limit point again is
what's included but it gives a lower utility than anywhere
as we approach this point x2 yeah so has a discontinuity if
x2 is different from one half because if x2 is one-half then
it will connect nicely to this point here so if x2 is different from one-half
there's a discontinuity and it jumps down to one-half now this means that
no position is actually the best response because it's always a better response

00:13
no matter how close we set up shop it's always a better response to set up just
even closer to x2 and this means that there's actually no
best response and the best response correspondence is empty for all
x2 they're different from one half what happens for one half well in that case
at x2 we get half of the customers and we still get half of the customers if we
deviate just by a infinitesimal amount to either side
and this means that we have a pure strategy nash equilibrium where both
vendors set up shop at exactly one half because we see the best response to one
half is one half and this is true for both players and so
clearly those are consistent now we could extend this to two
dimensions um it would be mathematically more complicated but
we are then able to to use it to predict how

00:14
businesses set up shop anywhere in a city and if you walk around taipei you may
have noticed that 711 and family mart always set up shop right across the
street from each other or right next to each other and the reason is
exactly the same because if they did not
then there would be a better response to set up shop closer to the competition
because we're unwilling to to move to walk too far for a convenience store
for the same reasons let's say gas stations always set up at the same
intersection and the reason is the same as in this example of the beach vendors
now this is known as hoteling's spatial competition and has nothing to do with
hotels is simply due to harald hoteling who first analyzed this

00:15
this special competition hoteling's model also has applications to voting um
last year 2020 there were quite a few presidential elections around the globe
um we had elections here in taiwan we're signing 101 with 57 percent of the vote
joe biden won 51 percent in poland anja duda one with 51 percent
and in croatia zoran villanovich one with 52
of the popular vote and we see that all of those are relatively close to 50
and can we explain this with a model similar to hoteling's competition
can we explain it with a model of voting where people vote for
the candidate who closely mac who most closely matches their political ideals
let's say we represent the spectrum the political spectrum with a unit interval
again so zero here is the very left edge of the political spectrum one would be
the very right edge of the political spectrum

00:16
and then people simply vote for their the politician that represents their
preferences the most closely now in such a model
the two candidates of the two parties would have an incentive exactly like in
the beach vendor setup to choose um political
positions that are exactly identical of each other
so that they both get half of the voter share while this does
represent sort of the outcome it doesn't really explain it too well from
an intuitive approach um we don't really see that
trump and biden have the same ideology so what what goes wrong here
also one thing that we have to consider is that for those two-party systems
the people first need to be nominated by their party to compete in the

00:17
presidential election so let's say if half of the spectrum is republican and
half is democrat then who most likely wins the democratic
nomination is whoever is in the center of the democratic opinion
and then for the republicans it will be whoever is in the center of the
republican opinion then we get something
where the two candidates are pretty much at let's say a quarter of the spectrum
and at three quarters of the spectrum then once they compete with each other
they pretty much get half of the vote now we see that if there's one party
without primaries if there's one party where the candidate does not have to
compete with others for the nomination then that party is an advantage because
that candidate can put themselves a bit closer to the center than they could if
they had to compete with other people from their own party this means that
incumbents have an advantage to get reelected and maybe this is why we saw that

00:18
zainwen won with 57 whereas non-incumbents only one with 51
or 52 percent of the vote yeah so this model is imperfect in the sense that
a political stance the political stance of a politician is
rather well known especially politicians that are sufficiently well known to be
candidating for presidency so the politicians don't really choose necessarily
their position on the line i mean they do but they can't change it
before an election at least not by much but what it illustrates here is that
the political candidate will win who is who who most closely represents the
preferences of the median voter and this is known as the median voter theorem
the proof is a little bit different it's not exactly hoteling's model but

00:19
hoteling's model is often used to explain the median voter theorem
let's now suppose that we have three vendors on the beach what would change
well let's first try to see what the utility function should be like let's say
vendor 1 sits up here vendor 2 sets up here and then well on the outside the
utility function will look exactly as it did before so if player 3 sets up
at the very edge of the beach then they only get half
of the customers between them and vendor
one and then the closer they set up shop to vendor one the more
customers they can serve and the same on the other side
what happens if they set up between the two vendors
then if they set up here let's say then well they get the customers that are
from right to middle between them and vendor 1 to the customers right between
the middle of them and vendor 2. and the difference here or the distance

00:20
if we subtract this one from the other one then we see
that x3 cancels out and they always just get exactly half of this interval right
because they lose one part here that they serve and then
they lose one part here this equally largest one that they serve so in the
end these are exactly half of the customers between x1 and 2. so
they will get a constant utility for setting up shop between x1 and x2
and then what happens if they set up exactly at x1 or x2 well in that case
they share the customers with vendor one but only those that are on this side of
the beach or if they set up here they share
customers with vendor two but only those on this side of the beach and so
the payoff that i get is exactly again half between those two points

00:21
again we see that the utilities are discontinuous mostly
there's one case which it would not be discontinuous how is that well
so essentially when those points match the
limit points from left and right match the utility for exactly choosing the
same location as another render so if we move x1 here to the left then
the limit point from the top will decrease and from the bottom will increase and
what's the left limit point here is exactly how far x1 is positioned on the
beach so the right limit point here is that as
well and then in between is exactly half the distance between x1 and x2
so this means that we will get a continuous utility function if x1 sets
up shop at one quarter and if x2 sets up shop at three quarters
and that's the only time when the utility function of player 3 the

00:22
response function is continuous and that's the only time when we can have
a best response because otherwise we always have this downward discontinuity
which means that there is no best response so in conclusion
the best response correspondence is empty unless
the two vendors set up shop at one quarter and three quarter in which case
the third vendor is willing to set up shop anywhere in between
what does this mean for pure strategy and ash equilibria well
it means there is none because if vendor three sets up shop here then vendor one
will have an incentive to deviate and set up shop closer to player three
if vendor 3 sets up shop here player 2 will have an incentive to deviate and if
player 3 sets up shop anywhere in between then the others two don't
actually have the best response so we see here that no pure strategy in
ash equilibrium can exist and so for the last video then we want to look at

00:23
how can we find mixed strategy nash equilibria or do mixed strategy nash
equilibrium even exist now a crucial role whether they exist is
played by those discontinuities and before i even show you the formal definition
what we're going to define here are upper semi-continuity and lower
semi-continuity so upper semi-continuous
function is one where the limit point is always above
where the limit point is always below the function value
so this is good for maximization lower semi-continuous function is one
where the limit point is above the function value so there's a
downward discontinuity and this is bad for maximization
so the formal definition is yeah as we approach a discontinuity x the limit is
below the function value regardless from which side that we approach

00:24
and lower simultaneous if it's the opposite if the limit is always
larger than the function value and then in the footnote you have the definition
of what the limb sub precisely mean but the important take away from here is
really what the graph of a upper and lower semi-continuous function looks like
and then we have this existence result for
reasonably upper semi-continuous payoffs we have again
the assumption on the domain which has to be compact convex and a subset of
euclidean space then we have the condition that the sum of the
players utilities is upper semi-continuous and then there's a third
condition that is actually rather complicated to state so i will simply
say discontinuities are sufficiently nice and rare
so i want to mostly talk about the second assumption here that the sum of

00:25
utilities is upper semicontinuous and so this means that the sum here
is essentially the social surplus that the players can divide amongst
themselves and the social surplus that must be
upper semi-continuous if the total surplus in the system has a downward
discontinuity at any point then we cannot really expect that an equilibrium
exists and this condition is satisfied by the
hoteling model and the burn through our model where players choose prices and
in that case it's actually continuous right so the total customers on the
beach are always the same so the total surplus is constant but
yeah sufficient for existence is actually upper semicontinuity and
yeah that's the existence result and in the next video then we will look at how

00:26
can we find those mixed strategy nash equilibrium for now though a few
questions for you to solve about how to find nash equilibria with a
continuum of actions and the literature um
yeah it's dealt with in foodenberg tyrol then we have the original paper by
hoteling for the spatial competition then we have the three
papers that show existence of a pure strategy nash equilibrium in if
we have this quasi-concave utilities and then the paper by das gupta and asking
that joe's existence for these discontinuous games
