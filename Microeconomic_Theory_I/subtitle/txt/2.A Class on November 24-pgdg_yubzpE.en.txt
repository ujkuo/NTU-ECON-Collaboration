all right this week we looked at nash equilibria and a nash equilibrium
is a strategy profile in which every player best responds to the strategies
of their opponents and in this definition there are two parts to this definition
somewhat hidden in the definition is the fact that players correctly
predict the behavior of their opponent so they essentially know
what their opponents are gonna play and then the second part is if we know
what our opponents are gonna play then we will best respond to it because we
are rational now here the notation here let me maybe emphasize this
so here if we only use sigma then this is the entire strategy profile of every

00:01
player so we could write it as sigma i and sigma
minus i or as the profile of all players and then on the right hand side on this
notation here means that well player i deviates from sigma i to s
i but everybody else plays the same that they do on the left hand side
so if we fix the behavior of all of i's opponents
and player i knows what they will play then player i has no incentive to
deviate from a nash equilibrium now how does this relate to the solution
concepts that we looked at last week well precisely through
the correct conjectures right so what sets nash equilibrium apart from
rationalizability is that the conjectures of every player are correct

00:02
so here i tried to summarize this once again the relation between the solution
concepts that we have seen and so crucially the players
know in a nash equilibrium what their opponents will play
whereas in rationalizability if fake strategy profile is
rationalizable then somebody some player eye strategy may not be a best response
to what the other players are playing but it is a best response to some
conjecture that can be justified all right
one question from the chat is why is it s i here and not sigma
so similar here to what you've shown in assignment one is that if
a player has a profitable deviation then they always have a profitable pure

00:03
strategy deviation so this condition is somehow easier to check for us because
we only have to um check that they have no
profitable deviations to pure strategies and this implies that they don't have
any profitable deviations to mix strategies either so you would also be
correct to write sigma tilde i here and then iests we have seen that
that in the end we don't necessarily get the best
response to the opponent's strategy profile but we it's not even a best response
necessarily to some valid conjecture over the strategy profiles that remain
i think the best way to visualize this the difference between rationalizability
and nash equilibrium is the example that we have started on last week's class

00:04
with and there was this example where a pedestrian and the driver tried to
cross the intersection and we have seen that every strategy
profile here is rationalizable um we can justify crossing if we believe
the other weights and we can justify waiting if we believe the other one crosses
and any mixture of them can be justified as well but we see here that
the profile where both players cross is rationalized by
conjectures that are completely wrong right so if we if both players believe
the other one will wait with certainty and they cross then this means that
exposed their beliefs were invalidated so if we want to you know make kind of
predictions of perfectly rational players it would be more satisfying if
if they aren't completely wrong in their beliefs and this is what we do in nash

00:05
equilibria the conjectures are correct so even if
so if the players knew what their opponents would play
they have no incentive to deviate so given that we know
the driver walks what will we do we will cross because one is higher than zero
whereas cc here if we know that the other one is crossing then we're not
going to cross as well in that case we're going to deviate and
choose to wait which is also a nash equilibrium
and then we add a third nash equilibrium where both players mix
sorry can i ask why the contractions ww is wrong so because it's
the opposite of what players actually do right so here the strategy profile is
what they actually do they actually cross but the players crossed because they

00:06
believed their opponent would wait and because it's not the same the
conjecture is wrong so if i guess a c and w but the x w and
w is is it also a round conjecture yeah then one of the players had a wrong
conjecture and the other player had the correct conjunction i see thank you
and then i think conceptually one of the most important parts of the class will
be when is it justified that we expect nash behavior so maybe first what is
a nash equilibrium it's really just that it's a set of
consistent outcomes where if the other if i knew what everybody else is playing
i would have no incentive to deviate and as such these are all the possible

00:07
outcomes of the game where players are rational and their beliefs are correct
so if we make these two impositions then the set of nash equilibria are all
possible outcomes of the game now if there is more than one nash
equilibrium we may wonder okay when does one happen and when the other
because this is a static game players have no way to communicate with each
other no way to coordinate and in that case indeed we should be
we shouldn't necessarily choose a single nash equilibrium as a prediction
yeah so we should use an individual nash equilibrium as a prediction only if
the assumption that the player's conjectures are correct can reasonably
be justified and we have seen some examples of this we have seen

00:08
that if a unique strategy profile survives to elimination of rationalizability
then only using common knowledge of rationality the players can arrive at
the correct conjecture this was the example in let's say the kuno
game this is one way they can logically deduce it
another way how they could correctly expect behavior is if there was explicit
communication before the game and communication can take many forms um
you and i could talk about it before we play a game
um we have the example of the traffic lights that tell us who is supposed to
walk and then once we know that this is everybody's
beliefs so if we know that if the traffic light is red for the cars then
then we know that we can walk and the cars they know that they they can't
cross because we are going to be crossing then if we

00:09
for some kind of evolutionary process if there's learning going on about the
opponent's strategy profile um then we could eventually arrive at the
correct prediction let's say if we play rock paper scissors infinitely many
times or many many times then maybe you'll start to see how i mix between
between the actions and then you can correctly predict my behavior
and best respond to it and then lastly um social norms or if a focal point where
if there is some behavior that is expected by everybody like saying hi in
the elevator or something like that then then that would be a nash equilibrium
that or a behavior that is expected and and that's how we can justify correct
conjectures as well okay that's sort of the big picture of

00:10
nash equilibria and they want to spend a decent amount of time this week on on
examples are there any questions so far all right let's start with the simplest
example that we could encounter and those were the two examples that
you you answered in poll everywhere and let's look at the game to the left first
and let's see how we could find nash equilibria here
now we have seen a few ways how we could do that we could
use indifference principle we could use um we could find the best response
correspondences or what i typically suggest you do first is first we eliminate
strictly dominated strategies because nash equilibrium can only place or
nash equilibrium are rationalizable so anything that is not

00:11
rationalizable cannot be a nash equilibrium and this will simplify finding best
response correspondences so in this game here let's see what strategies are
dominated so we see if we look at it we see that right for player 2
is dominated by a left so regardless of what player 1 does
player 2 is better off choosing left and so we can eliminate right
and given that right is eliminated we see that now
choosing top is strictly better for player one than choosing down
so we can eliminate down and then lastly the only player left with with a choice
is player two and player two prefers n among the responses and
this means that if there is a unique uniquely rationalizable strategy profile

00:12
this has to be the nash equilibrium because we know
any such game has a nash equilibrium right that's it for the left one
for the right one i would like to to show the two approaches um using
the indifference principle and the best response correspondences and then see
how do they differ let's first try to use the indifference principle and find
nash equilibria this way so the first thing that we would do is we would look at
pure strategy nash equilibria so if player 1 plays t player 2's best response is
to choose left if player 1 plays d player 2's best response is r

00:13
then if we fix left by by player 2 then choosing top or down is the best
response because player 1 isn't different and then lastly if player 2 chooses r
then choosing down is a best response by player 1.
and we see that we have two pure strategy nash equilibrium top left and
down right now to find the mixed equilibrium let's
try to use the indifference principle let me switch to my sketchbook for this
alright so with the indifference principle we try to find
a strategy for let's say player two that makes player one indifferent

00:14
so for player two we can write the strategy as let's say y times left plus
with probability 1 minus y we choose right and then
by the indifference principle player 1 should be indifferent so maybe let me
write indifference principle so player 1 is indifferent we if top and down
yield the same utility and if we go back to the utility
function then we see that okay if player 2 chooses left then
then player one will get two regardless of what player one plays
and then they get one if downright is chosen alright so choosing

00:15
top it's two if player two plays left so two times y and for choosing down
[Music] so for choosing down always gives at
least one but it gives one additional payoff unit if player 2 plays left so we
can write this as 1 plus y now when are those the same it's if y equals one
okay then we can do the same for the other player are there any questions so far
then for the other player we we're choosing left

00:16
choosing left does not matter what player one does so always be one and
choosing right will give us three payoff units if player one cruises down
and those are the same those are identical if x is two thirds
and so we get a mixed a completely mixed nash equilibrium and left
okay this is the approach using the indifference principle now i mentioned that
the problem with the indifference principle is that we don't necessarily

00:17
get all the solutions because it's only a property that has to be
satisfied in any nash equilibrium or any mixed nash equilibrium
but it's not sufficient what is sufficient is a mutual best
response so let's try to solve the same game using a
using best response correspondences now for best response correspondences best
response correspondences what we do is we parametrize
an arbitrary strategy profile so this was just x choosing top

00:18
and then probability y choosing left and we compute
let's say player one's utility in it and also here
if player 2 chooses left we always get 2 regardless of what player 1 plays
so that gives us 2 y and if player 2 chooses right then we get 1
if we choose down which happens with probability 1 minus x
and to find the best response we take the derivative with respect to
player one's choice variable so that would be with respect to x and
that's minus one minus y so this is y minus one and

00:19
we find the best response correspondence to strategy two pi player two
which can be one of two things well it could either be
well either we're indifferent if y is one or if y is less than one
then choosing down is a unique best response okay that was it for
for player one are there any questions how do we do that
we do the same for player two so here if we look at the utility it's
again one for choosing left regardless of what player one does but now it's

00:20
three for choosing if downright is realized so we have y plus three one minus y
one minus x is three x minus two and we get players 2 player 2's best
response correspondence so if x is sufficiently large
this quantity will be positive which means that
increasing the probability of choosing left will lead to a payoff increase so

00:21
it's maximized at y equals one if x is larger than
two-thirds where player two is indifferent if x is equal to two-thirds and
which was right if x is smaller than two-thirds
and then to find all nash equilibria we check consistency
and we go through these three cases so if oops if x is larger than two-thirds
then well then y has to be one y is one and if y equals to one then here we have

00:22
that um anything by player one is a best response so this is consistent if
x is equal to two-thirds that that means player player two
uh player one has to be willing to mix right so in order for for player one to
to be willing to mix it must be that y is equal to one otherwise mixing would
not be a best response by by player one that means also y equals one

00:23
and that's again consistent and then lastly if x is smaller than two-thirds
then y has to be zero as we see here y zero is the best
response to x smaller than two thirds and then if y is zero then we have to
have x is equal to zero as well and this is consistent so this gives us
the nash equilibrium down right we've found this before and these give
us the nash equilibria x top plus 1 minus x down left
for x larger or equal than two-thirds and we see that we get infinitely many
infinitely many nash equilibria that we did not get using the

00:24
indifference principle and the reason why we didn't get those
with indifference principle is because in this nash equilibrium
player 2 does not have to be indifferent right because player 2 does not mix
whereas in the previous in the indifference principle we have
assumed both players are indifferent but player two doesn't have to be
indifferent and so even if player one chooses
top with the probability larger than two-thirds then player two is willing to
choose left and it's a strict best response in that case
good any questions about how we solve finite games so first use

00:25
first eliminate some strategies and then use best response correspondences
um i want to ask about the utility of the player one yes um
can you say that again why we don't consider the down strategy
uh can you repeat that um the player one play why don't
the player one play down the strategy down i mean they play the strategy down if
player 2 chooses right because it's a strict best response but
in the other nash equilibrium where player 1 mixes
player 1 has to choose top with probability at least two thirds for
player two to be willing to choose left right if player
one chooses both of them equally then left would not be a best response

00:26
by player 2 and then player 2 would choose r instead
so here the reason why x has to be larger than 2 3 is so that it's the best
response for player 2 to choose left no no yeah i'm i'm asking about the utility
function in the second bullet here yeah right um we only consider that why is
tl right 2y is from tl the table from tl oh 2y is the entire row
so we could write this with an intermediate step we could write this as
2 yx plus 2 y 1 minus x oh okay okay [Music]

00:27
yeah that's that's all about my question yeah okay then the next
most important example that we're going to encounter is nash equilibria with
or in games with a continuum of actions where we have
nice concave differentiable utilities and and i want to show again sort of the
the incorrect approach first of how we can solve it and then the correct
approach how we get all the nash equilibrium so this one here is
the same example that we have seen last week but the difference is now that
there's we want to solve it for general parameters p0 which is the price
when there is no no supply and general ci which is the caused by the two firms
and we want to solve the nash equilibria for all of those parameterizations at

00:28
the same time so so maybe the first intuition is that we look at the best
responses and we take the partial derivative of the two players so um
we look for pure strategy equilibrium so ui of q was um see e0 minus c1

00:29
and we take the partial derivatives and we see this is
our first guess might be okay let's set this equal to zero to find a maximum and
then we find q i is p0 minus c i minus q minus i over two
and a nash equilibrium would then be where they are equal to each other so
q i is p 0 minus c i minus p 0 minus minus i so here we just plug in
player minus i is best response for q minus i and then we can solve this for qi

00:30
and what we obtain here okay so we have p zero half and then
minus p zero quarter so we have p zero quarter left minus c i half
and here we get plus c minus i quarter and then plus q i over four
now we can bring qi quarter to the other side so we get or subtract and
divide by three quarters um now there is a problem with this

00:31
approach does anybody know what went wrong so let's try to choose specific
parameters so previously we had let's say p0 was 100
c1 was 10 and let's say firm 2 now has a very high cost let's say 70.
so what is our prediction here okay for firm for firm 1 we have 100 minus
20 plus 70 that's 150 divided by 3 so that's 50. and for firm 2
we would get a 100 minus 140 plus 10 so that would be minus 10. exactly raymond
replied in the chat we're only considering interior solutions and
that's a problem because the maximum could be obtained at the boundary

00:32
and we see things especially the prediction here that does not make sense
firm two would not produce a negative quantity
and we can't now just say okay for improvement which is zero because that
will change the response by firm one so how do how do we do this correctly um
throughout the entire derivation so we need to notice here that this is only
the best response if it's an interior solution but a best response could be
at the boundary let me save this and then

00:33
so i guess starting from here we have to use a different approach [Music]
this is an interior point interior a boundary point there's only one
boundary point here q i is equal to zero is the best response when is this the
best response well it's the best response if if the price is negative
right if the other company produces so much that the price is negative without
our participation then we shouldn't produce anything and so this is if the

00:34
other company just produces more than p0 minus ci and
so if we put both of them together um we see that the actual best response
correspondence is oops um if the switch for each firm
okay so is what we have derived before so p0 minus c one minus q two half if

00:35
q two is smaller what is this more than or equal and it's zero otherwise and
to verify consistency let me also write it down for for player 2.

00:36
and we again go through all the cases and the first so if
i guess let's look at the cases first where one produces zero so if q2
is larger than p0 minus c1 then q1 is zero and if q1 is zero this means
q2 has to be equal to this ratio here so this means q2 is equal to minus c 2 2.
so firm 2 produces the monopoly quantity now when is this consistent well let's
see it has to be consistent with what we started with so it's consistent

00:37
if and only if so if p0 minus c2 over 2 is larger than p0 minus c1 so we can
we can we express this identity as 2 c1 minus c2 is larger than p0 and we get
the symmetric reply if um if we're in the other case here now this is one and

00:38
so if q1 is larger than p0 minus c2 we get symmetric
symmetric equilibrium and then lastly if neither of those cases are satisfied
then we do what we've done previously then we plug in the best responses to
each other and we get what we had before which was q i is p0 minus
was it 2 c i plus c minus i or 3. and we can check that this is consistent
if and only if 2 c i minus c minus i is smaller equal then t zero

00:39
so in this way we get the nash equilibria for all possible cases of the
parameters [Music] are there any questions so far
so it's really important that in the best response correspondence we allow or
we account for the boundary points and one thing that i should also mention is
we have to check that this is a this is actually a best response
by looking at the second order sufficient conditions
so if we look at the second derivative and we see that this is strictly concave
which means the utility function is something like this and
in that case so wherever the first order condition is satisfied is indeed a

00:40
maximum which makes it a best response so at the beginning of the class i
mentioned that the method somehow is more important in in graduate
game theory than than the solution and so here i really want to emphasize it is
important that you check that this is indeed a best response so that it's indeed
a maximum of player i's utility and reject that with the second order
condition and by checking when the boundary points might be best responses
any questions okay so those are the two by far the two most
important types of examples that you will encounter throughout the course
there are finitely many actions and there are continuum of actions with a

00:41
very nice typically strictly concave utility function and
and this is really the the most important part of this week's class so
before i continue i just want to make sure everybody understands everything up
to here actually i think this is a good point to go through the questions
um that you answered on poll everywhere so how many nash equilibria are in
against the left so this is was very good this there is one nash
equilibrium that survives um rationalizability that was the left gain here
now for those of you who are applied zero um
we have the nash existence theorem which tells us that at least one of them must
exist so zero cannot be the answer to any of those two games

00:42
so in the second game we've seen there are infinitely many and the reason
why there are infinitely many is because we have this weak dominance of of
strategies right so down is weakly dominant but player one
is willing to play top given that player two plays left
and we can find those infinitely many nash equilibria using
the best response correspondences are any questions to those two
oh sorry can you hear me yes also i have a question let's um
when can we be sure that we don't have a mixed strategy naturally
quickly but for example like if there will be the case that
after computing uh best response my mixed strategy will detract my rate

00:43
to pure strategy would it be the case that i only have pure strategic national
coding it could be so yeah the the best way to make sure
that you have all nash equilibria is to use the mutual best responses
because that's really the definition of a nash equilibrium and it means that we
have found all of them yeah okay yeah thanks then
no strictly dominated actions are in the support of any nash equilibrium that's
correct um nash equilibria must be rationalizable and in particular
no strategy and support can be strictly dominated
right so this was the inclusion that we had of the solution concept that is

00:44
is a larger or produces more outcomes than than nash equilibrium
then in every outcome of a mixed nash equilibrium every player best responds
to the other player's outcome the answer's false so this is not correct and
the reason is that mixing is done independently
of the players uh let me go back to this example here so in
the mixed equilibrium um the two players mix and given that the
other strategy mixes then our then we are indifferent so we can choose
anything as the best response but if both players mix
then what's the probability that cc happens so cc happens with probability

00:45
well one-fifth times one-fifth so that's about four percent that's four percent
oh because they mix independently the bad outcome will happen with with
positive probability and now in this outcome the players don't best respond
to each other and the reason here is that players
really choose the distribution so there's no better distribution to respond to
but this is only true you know ex-ante before we know what happens once we
realize the outcome then then it must not be that they mutually
best respond to each other are there any questions about this

00:46
sorry can you explain again that what do you mean like uh
what what is this question like the uh every player best response to the other
player's outcome i cannot quite understand this
the question itself is the problem um oh maybe the question is not perfectly
worded but the idea is that in a mixed nash equilibrium players choose
you know a distribution over pure actions and only the distributions
are best responses to each other but not everything
in the support of those distributions so not every outcome that can happen
is the best satisfies a mutual best response property so in this example
the car crash can happen or will happen in the mixed equilibrium with four

00:47
percent and in this outcome neither player best response to the other
so this is something to keep in mind when we work with mixed nash equilibria
is that even though players best respond to each other
there might both still be some very bad outcomes that happen with positive
probability and since there was a question on on paul everywhere about
the payoffs let me address this right now because it fits nicely
so the the payoffs that can be attained in a
mixed nash equilibrium in this example is here the yellow set and the reason

00:48
why it doesn't extend all the way to the to the convex hall here is because
whenever both players attach positive probability to crossing
then we will get the crash with positive probability which is a very negative
utility for both and in general the set of mixed or the set of
utilities that can be attained in a mixed strategy will be will be smaller
than the comics hull and it'll be strictly smaller whenever the
the pure strategy utilities differ by the strategy of more than one one player
so here the entire boundary is contained because we can attain the entire
boundary when player two crosses and player one mixes
then we'll get anything on this boundary but we can't attain this here because

00:49
both players have to mix in order to get something in between but
if both players mix we will also get this very negative utility
uh excuse me can you hear me yes i i want to ask uh some questions about
this graph yes if like uh both players have like more than three
strategy then we have more points on this graph and how can we
like draw this mixed action payoff uh my suggestion is to use a computer
that's how i i drew this um so what can we say in general um in
general we can say that maybe okay oops ah so if we have two extreme payoffs

00:50
then any payoff in between are part of the strategy payoffs if
they differ only by the strategy of one player so if let's say this is s i
s minus i and this is as tilde i as minus i then this
boundary here can be or the entire line segment can be obtained by mixing by
player one at player i but if this is not the case if we have something here and
it involves a very different strategy profile let's
say by all opponents and typically the boundary will look something like this
now deriving this analytically is quite complicated um you would have to find
the entire set and then take the supremum over the set and then the
derivative to find the boundary so that's why i suggest um

00:51
just use a computer to find instead of all utilities that can be attained in a
mixed strategy thank you sorry i want to ask a following question
yes if i use a traffic light can i reach the right above triangle that is not in
the graph exactly if we use a traffic light then what we can attain
is we can attain any distribution over over outcomes
which is larger than the set of mixed strategies so if we have the correlation
the public correlation then we can attain the entire convex hall

00:52
so this was a traffic light example okay then
we can find all nash equilibrium by applying the indifference principle to
all possible possible combinations of the support and that's also false
um as we have seen in in the example here there are infinitely many
and with indifference principle we only get three of them
then about continuum of actions if we have an interval
of pure strategies available then any strategy satisfying the two conditions
is a best response let's see the conditions

00:53
so we have first order necessary in the second order sufficient condition um
this is not necessarily true because it could be a local maximum
so what could happen is if we draw the utility of player i
if this is sort of oops the interval oof ah this is not a very nice graph
let's just look at this then this point here
would satisfy the two properties which means it's a local maximum
but it's not the global maximum we see here the global maximum is a boundary
plan right so this only means local maximum now typically
in the games you encounter we have strict concavity in which case

00:54
local maximum is a global maximum if it's in the domain
so in general this is false then the converse is also false
because a boundary point does not satisfy these conditions
right so not every best response satisfies those two
in fact here the boundary point um the derivative is positive strictly positive
and that's why we choose the highest possible point that we can choose
it's increasing all the way to the edge and then

00:55
the maximum is obtained at the edge of the domain then the next one
about existence a if your strategy nash equilibrium does
not exist if the utility function fails to be upper semi-continuous um
this is false um it's not guaranteed to exist but it might exist
right so one thing to keep in mind if we look at these
at these existence results is that even if they are not satisfied there
might be a pure strategy nash equilibrium we just don't have a general
proof for it it's important to keep in mind those are sufficient conditions

00:56
not necessary conditions and we have seen quite a few examples where there was a
pure strategy nash equilibrium even though the utility function is not upper
semicontinuous like the beach vendors example or the
or somber trunk competitions also have the pure strategy equilibrium last
last question which condition of kaputani's fixed point theorem fails to
hold with a continuous action set and all conditions are satisfied i see that
the students generally think that i will try to ask a trick question but
if all the conditions are satisfied this would mean that the proof would work
in for infinite strategy sets so this would mean we always had existence
so something cannot hold so it's not possible that it's the last answer

00:57
otherwise we would have existence for all those games and
here we just there's two ways how we can how we can find the right answer one is
okay when we looked at these examples where there might not be an equilibrium
what went wrong and we have seen that the best response correspondence
sometimes is empty so here we had sometimes it was empty
so this is one way how we can find out about which one is violated by looking
at the examples we've looked at the other one is we go go back to the
proof and see where have we needed there are finitely many and it was here
that there are finitely many strategies and we have indeed used it to show that
well if there's finitely many the maximum over finitely many strategies is

00:58
attained if we have infinitely many then we would get a supremum here
instead of a maximum which is what happens precisely if we
have an increasing utility where the end point is not included so then
there might be um not there might not be a best response
excuse me yes how do you see that xxx is always compact i i'm like yes so
there's a famous result from from topology which says that
um it's called pikonov's theorem and it says that the product of any compact
space is compact um but but but now like if you have a a

00:59
continuous action set then how do you know that the distribution of the uh
like you have infinite uh even action so how how do you know that the
the set of distribution is complex um it's a good question um so
i'm sure there is a theorem that says it's compact um
the idea is or when would it not be compact and sort of if limit points
were not included but so a distribution um has

01:00
reasonable limit properties in the sense that um
what really makes a distribution is that the total weight assigned is one and
it's non-negative and can we like uh because uh um baby supporters should be
uh the atom should be countable and like like like
doing limit with those atoms and i i don't know i'm just
i don't think it's it doesn't have anything to do with the atoms um it's simply
i mean the best way to illustrate this is unfortunately not in an infinite
strategy space but in in a two strategy space and the set of all distributions
is then given by the probability with which we choose let's say action one
question one action two and then we have here the probability x

01:01
with which we choose it and the defining conditions of a distribution
would here be that x is smaller or larger than zero then
one minus x which is the probability of the other action is also larger or equal
than zero and we have that the sum of the two is equal to one um [Music]
maybe actually a better way to to write it is
the the the set is clearly compared when
when we are doing with finite actions so
i'm sure but what i'm trying to say here is that because all of those are weak
inequalities essentially they are robust to taking limits okay
even if we have an infinite strategy spec space yeah yeah

01:02
that makes sense thank you okay then those were all the questions that i
asked you and i will now go through some of the the
questions from that you asked on um on paul everywhere
and quite a few questions were here about condition three so let me walk you
through the steps of this proof again so we try to find here is we try to
show that this best response or mutual best response correspondence has
a closed graph what does a closed graph mean it means that
if we have some some sequence of of strategy profiles oops
sequence of strategy profiles but then the limit point is

01:03
included so here we have sort of strategy profiles by eye's opponent and
here on this dimension we have um the best response by player i
and so in a sense that if along an approximating sequence
we always choose the best response by player i then in the limit
we also have to obtain a best response so formally we start with the end point
here and we approximate the strategy profile with a sequence in the graph
right so player i best responds to i's opponents
now here for this proof we can do this for a fixed player i oops
for a fixed player i which means that the other players don't
necessarily have to best respond to each other this is just player i best

01:04
respond to i's opponents and we try to see yes there's a question
and i don't know if i'm correct but like to use triangle inequality i think the
fourth bullet point we should have ui uh sigma i naught s i
because that we want to help triangle triangular equality so i
think we should rely on the not not involved uh
one to hold to state the triangle in quality when i read this i cannot quite
understand yeah i'll get there s i should be
correct here but let me let me just walk you through all this okay until we get
there um yeah so now we so first we set up the proof with with
this statement we have this approximating sequence where player i

01:05
best responds all along the sequence and we want to show that in the limit it
has to imply a best response by player i and the typical way to prove it is to
suppose that this is not true suppose that in the limit player i does not best
respond this means there is a better response
some pure strategy si that yields a strictly larger utility now the thing is
that because we have this convergence and the utility
is continuous in mixing it means that u i sigma i k sigma minus i k converges to
[Music] the i sigma and this means that for some k sufficiently large ui sigma i

01:06
k minus sigma i k differs from the limit here by
a small amount let's say smaller than epsilon half
and actually we should probably use epsilon third third now we know that s i is
epsilon better than sigma i we know that sigma i k sigma i or the the uh
the approximation is that most of silence are different and we can also get um

01:07
we can also get that u i s i and sigma minus i k differs by u i s i sigma
minus i by at most epsilon third and if we put all of these together we
see that okay s i was better than or epsilon better than sigma i
so first we can use this inequality to ensure that okay si um
exceeds this payoff here by at least two epsilon thirds and exceeds um
oh i'm making a mess here this should be sigma okay so that you just said here

01:08
this differs only by a third epsilon this differs
only by a third of silence on the left in the end we still get an improvement
by one-third epsilon and so in the limit so i guess if we use
these intermediate steps this should be epsilon third here and
but it still means that that this here would be epsilon third [Music]
um it still means that s i is a strictly better response than
than sigma ik and it's a contradiction that
that along the sequence player i best responded to the others excuse me yes

01:09
i think that uh you cannot write sigma k here you you can only write s i sigma
sigma negative i um um utility is continuous in any players mixing yeah so so
but but si is not converged to sigma i so
oh yeah that's correct yeah yeah we have to we have to only you look at the
difference here from sigma k to this one here um so that should the the the
uh the area here is sigma okay and that's that that is the last
so it should be like s i sigma k negative i and s i so you can compare
uh uisi sigma negative i k to to the first term and and the rest the the

01:10
second term yes and you can yeah correct thank you so uh [Music]
another question about about the main concept of this proof is um
what we were trying to say that if there is a convergence sequence
in the graph then the limit is also in the graph but um
if we do so then we cannot actually if we pick a point
in the graph we cannot assure that the sigma ik is in bi sigma k in negative i
so yes because that's the graph of b i so yeah but
uh so so i i think you need to pick some like sigma i prime or something

01:11
like you need to pick another strategy to to to to
to construct another conversion sequence so you have two companies
one one is the profile and one is the point you pick in bi
oh but so here we have let's say a visualization right so here we only
approximate so like if you pick if you pick it up
so that the graph is closed right so we need to look at a sequence in the graph
yes right so any such sequence or any sigma
which has such an approximating sequence
right this is the condition that we need it's not true that we can
approximate any strategy profile like this we can only
um what we need is we need really an approximating sequence you know so

01:12
the sigma ik here is not um let me let me check the sigma ik here is not the the
entry in the strategy profile of sigma k it is yes it is but
it's not true that this works for arbitrary sigma right we choose
a sequence of strategy profiles essentially choose i don't know
let me just clear this work again okay so here we start with um a sequence
sigma minus i k that approximates sigma minus i
and for each of those we choose um sigma i in p i sigma minus i k

01:13
and then we define sigma k as consisting of all of those you need a case
if there are more questions i i i i said the trick here thank you sorry what
i i i i i know i know what you're saying now thank you good okay then
okay this class has lasted already for quite a while so let me go through or
show an example about mixing as well before we conclude the class so
so those that we started with are by far the most the most important
examples that you'll encounter but then there are some examples in which the

01:14
utility functions aren't extremely nice in which case we have
pure strategy equilibrium if we have quasi concavity and
they may not exist if we have discontinuous utilities um
so for all these games with discontinuous utilities if they do exist
pure strategy nash equilibria then they typically have the property that
the utility function of each player is continuous in their own strategy given
the equilibrium action of the opponents so we have seen this in
in the vendors on the beach example where the utility function was
the only way how it could be continuous is precisely in the nash equilibrium
where both players choose one half and so it precisely had this property here

01:15
now in most games that we encounter in economic applications typically
if the utility is discontinuous then typically this happens because we have
some discontinuous division of the social surplus
and the social surplus itself is continuous
and in that case we have existence of a mixed nash equilibrium by das gupta and
maskin and somebody asked me in the paul everywhere
questions to look at an example one more example of a bertrand competition and
let's try to find a pure or mixed strategy nash equilibrium
here in the bertrand competition so one example
that i mentioned earlier in the course was if we sell financial derivatives then
this is typically a bertrand competition where we quote a price to to the buyer

01:16
so typically financial derivatives are sold by investment banks and they
they insure themselves against the risk by hedging and so the price or the cost
at which they can provide this financial derivative
is essentially the cost at which they can hedge this derivative
and typically commercial banks like like juan and bank
would go to an investment bank to buy some financial derivatives and then the
commercial bank tries to sell them to end users like you and me and they ask
different investment banks for a quote they say i want to have
a lot of call options on on this company and
each investment bank quotes a price and then typically the commercial bank will
choose to buy from whoever quoted the lowest price

01:17
and this precisely fits into the model of bertrand competition um
the investment bank that quotes the lower price can sell
um can satisfy the entire demand and if they quote the same price they
will share demand equally now let's first see at pure strategy
nash equilibria here so let's draw the utility function um if we
code so let's fix some price of our opponent and our cost then
our utility function has slope one is strictly increasing
if we quote a lower price because then we satisfy the entire demand right so
this function here is p i minus c i then if we quote the same price we sell half
of it so it's precisely in between here and then if we quote a higher price we
don't sell anything and our profit is zero

01:18
now let's turn this into a best response correspondence so if
the opponent quotes a price that is higher than our cost then we don't have
a best response right because it's discontinuous here if our opponent
quotes exactly our cost then we're indifferent between um
between selling and not selling because our profit will be zero in that case we
have a best response so in that case the utility function would be would be
like this right so it's we don't want to quote the price lower but
quoting a price above or the same price doesn't matter because we'll always get
zero and then if they quote a price that is lower then we want to overbid

01:19
our opponent because we would make a negative return so if we formalize this
if our opponents go to higher price then there's no best response because we
always want to just under bid by a very small amount if they quote
our cost then anything above our cost is the best response
and finally if they underbid our costs then we don't want to compete
then anything where we don't sell anything is the best response now
if we look at the consistency here then um
so it's clear to see that our opponent cannot quote anything larger than our
our cost in an equilibrium because otherwise we don't have a best response
but they also can't really quote anything that is lower because if they
quoted anything that is lower they always have a better response to quote
something slightly closer to our cost right they want to be as close to our

01:20
cost as possible but just below it and so the only way for there to be in
equilibrium is if both companies have the same marginal costs and
the price is at the marginal cost now let's see if we can use this intuition
to find a mixed strategy nash equilibrium and let's look at a parametrization
where there is no pure strategy nash equilibrium so let's say one of the
firms has a lower cost and in the example i mentioned with the
financial derivatives would be that um let's say one bank underestimates the
risk that is involved in this financial derivative

01:21
then it believes it can hedge it at a lower cost than it actually can so you
would have the lower cost than the other firm and
what could our guess be for a nash equilibrium well okay
the more competitive firm bank one so let's say bank two does not want to
quote anything below c2 and bank one definitely wants to underbid bank two
by a tiny amount so our guess could be that
if the equilibrium was any any quantity larger than c2
then the first company would underbid it so
what we have to have in the end is that the first firm sells at the price
at the cost of firm two and this would be a
there's no pure study in ash equilibrium

01:22
because there's a discontinuity there so we must have that
firm 2 does not sell at that price but it sells it starts mixing at that price
so let's see if we can turn that into a mixed nash equilibrium look at my notes
um okay so so if bank one sets the price at the cost of
bank two then bank two gets zero anyway so anything that they do

01:23
so any distribution so any f on c2 infinity is a best response for firm 2.
and for firm 1 we had to have that there is no atom
otherwise it would have an incentive to underbid
and so for one we can compute the expect the utility so
so it's the probability with which firm one quotes a lower price
then firm two in that case the cell to the entire they satisfy the entire demand
and this is precisely one minus f p1 so if they quote any price

01:24
this is their expected utility well if they quote the equilibrium price
so on the path or maybe in equilibrium okay the in equilibrium the price is
c2 minus c1 and they satisfy the entire demand
so the only conditions that we have for a nash equilibrium is that this is
larger or equal than one minus f p p minus c one and we can solve it for f p
and it means f p has to be larger or equal than p minus c 2 over p minus c 1.

01:25
and that's it that's a mixed nash equilibrium with two conditions so the
mixing starts at c2 but assigns probability zero to c2
itself and then it increases sufficiently fast so that firm one does not have an
incentive to deviate to a higher price and so this function here p minus c2
this takes something of a form like that and so anything um
any probability distribution c two so anything above it is fine so let's say a

01:26
a uniform distribution on some interval works are there any questions
so if i were to ask you in an assignment
to find such a mixed equilibrium i would typically give you
the boundary point of the support so you have a place to start [Music]
now in this case the indifference condition for the mixing player was
trivially satisfied because they get zero for all their actions
but in the video you have seen an example where we can use the
indifference condition to uniquely pin down the distribution with which the

01:27
players have to mix good any questions all right if not then i would like to
conclude the class here um let me emphasize that the really the most important
applications of this week are if there are finitely many actions or
utility functions are really nice now this one here takes some practice but
you will get to practice in one of the assignments
if you have additional questions that i didn't address um
i'll stick around here let's we can just add an office hour right here to answer
all the other questions but sort of the new material that we discuss um
we will we will conclude the class here uh sorry i have a question a general

01:28
question oh can you hear me yes i can hear you so
so uh i i i guess in general uh using gas and verify only helps us find some
some equilibrium out of equilibrium and is that true
what helps us find some but not all right so so using case and verify in the
setting of mixing on continuous guessing and verifying yes and
in that case how about those equilibria that we do not find or maybe we cannot
find um so um oops um in this example here actually with asymmetric costs

01:29
uh it is unknown what all the mixed nash equilibria are um so
in that case so it will always be enough to find one
because typically it's so complicated to find all of them
that i mean nobody has done it so far so i'm not gonna ask you to do it um yeah
but yes it's true that this will only give you one equilibrium um
but we're gonna be satisfied with one equilibrium in these instances
okay thanks so i i mean i mean in general people criticize that
well in research what problem we only find part of equilibrium are not all
equally good um i mean so all it depends on the context
so what we're typically happy with is if we find a reasonable equilibrium um

01:30
or the optimal equilibrium right so if we have a specific
specific research question and we're trying to find um
let's say a a climate agreement between different countries then if we can find
the equilibrium that attains and so it's the pareto efficient equilibrium
then typically it's enough to find that one
so finding all of them is is not usually required um because
yeah it could be intractable in many moments so it actually depends on how
insightful the equilibrium is it's not dependent thank you
